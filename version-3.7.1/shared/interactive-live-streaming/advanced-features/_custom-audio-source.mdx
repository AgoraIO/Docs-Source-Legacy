## Introduction

By default, the Agora SDK uses default audio and video modules for capturing and rendering in real-time communications. 

However, the default modules might not meet your development requirements, such as in the following scenarios:

- Your app has its own audio or video module.
- You want to use a non-camera source, such as recorded screen data.
- You need to process the captured video with a pre-processing library for functions such as image enhancement.
- You need flexible device resource allocation to avoid conflicts with other services.

This page explains how to customize the audio source with the Agora Web SDK.

## Implementation

Before customizing the audio source, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions. For details, see [Start a call](/3.7.1/video-calling/quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk) or [Start Live Interactive Streaming](../quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming).

When creating a stream with the `createStream` method, you can specify the customized audio source by the [`audioSource`](./API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.streamspec.html#audiosource) property when creating a stream.
For example, you can use the `mediaStream` method to get the audio track from `MediaStreamTrack`, and then set `audioSource`:

```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(
    {video: false, audio: true}
).then(function(mediaStream){
    var audioSource = mediaStream.getAudioTracks()[0];
    // After processing audioSource
    var localStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
        video: false,
        audio: true,
        audioSource: audioSource
    });
    localStream.init(function(){
        client.publish(localStream, function(e){
            //...
        });
    });
});
```

<div class="alert info"><code>MediaStreamTrack</code> refers to the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> object supported by the browser. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack API</a> for details.</div>

We also provide an open-source [AgoraAudioIO-Web-Webpack](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Advanced-Audio/tree/master/Web/AgoraAudioIO-Web-Webpack) demo project on GitHub. You can try the demo, or view the source code in the [rtc-client.js](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Advanced-Audio/blob/master/Web/AgoraAudioIO-Web-Webpack/src/rtc-client.js) file.
