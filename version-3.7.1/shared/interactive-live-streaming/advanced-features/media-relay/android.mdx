## Introduction

Co-hosting across channels refers to the process where the Agora SDK relays the media stream of a host from an interactive live streaming channel (source channel) to a maximum of four interactive live streaming channels (destination channels). It has the following benefits:

- All hosts in the relay channels can see and hear each other.
- The audience members in the relay channels can see and hear all hosts.

Co-hosting across channels applies to scenarios such as an online singing contest, where hosts of different channels interact with each other.


## Sample project

Agora provides an open-source [HostAcrossChannel](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/blob/master/Android/APIExample/app/src/main/java/io/agora/api/example/examples/advanced/HostAcrossChannel.java) sample project on GitHub. You can download the project to try it out or view the source code.

## Implementation

<div class="alert note">To enable channel media relay, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a>.</div>

Before relaying media streams across channels, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions in your project.

As of v2.9.0, the Agora Native SDK supports co-hosting across channels with the following methods:

- `startChannelMediaRelay`
- `updateChannelMediaRelay`
- `stopChannelMediaRelay`

Once the channel media relay starts, the SDK relays the media streams of a host from the source channel to at most four destination channels.

During the relay, the SDK reports the states and events of the channel media relay with the `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged` and `onChannelMediaRelayEvent` callbacks. Refer to the following codes and their corresponding states to implement your code logic:

| State codes | Event codes | The media stream relay state |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| RELAY_STATE_RUNNING(2) and RELAY_OK(0)      | RELAY_EVENT_PACKET_SENT_TO_DEST_CHANNEL(4)     | The channel media relay starts.      |
| RELAY_STATE_FAILURE(3)      | /     | Exceptions occur for the media stream relay. Refer to the error parameter for troubleshooting.      |
| RELAY_STATE_IDLE(0) and RELAY_OK(0)      | /     | The channel media relay stops.      |

<div class="alert note"><ul><li>Any host in an interactive live streaming channel can call the <code>startChannelMediaRelay</code> method to enable channel media stream relay. The SDK relays the media streams of the host who calls the method.</li>
<li>During the media stream relay, if the host of the destination channel drops offline or leaves the channel, the host of the source channel receives the <code>onUserOffline</code> callback.</li></ul></div>

### API call sequence

Follow the API call sequence to implement your code logic:

![1568962085119](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1568962085119)

### Sample code

```java
// Initializes RtcEngine.
engine = RtcEngine.create(context.getApplicationContext(), yourAppId, iRtcRngineEventHandler);

...

// Guides the user to set the destination channel name, and assigns the name to destChannelName.
String destChannelName = et_channel_ex.getText().toString();
if(destChannelName.length() == 0){
  showAlert("Destination channel name is empty!");
}

// Configures the source channel information. For channelName, use the source channel name set by the user. For myUid, set it as 0.
// Note that sourceChannelToken is different from the token used for joining the source channel. You need to generate sourceChannelToken with the source channel name and a uid of 0.
ChannelMediaInfo srcChannelInfo = new ChannelMediaInfo(et_channel.getText().toString(), sourceChannelToken, myUid);
ChannelMediaRelayConfiguration mediaRelayConfiguration = new ChannelMediaRelayConfiguration();
mediaRelayConfiguration.setSrcChannelInfo(srcChannelInfo);

// Configures the destination channel information. Set destChannelName as the channel name set by the user. myUid is the user ID that the user uses in the destination channerl.
ChannelMediaInfo destChannelInfo = new ChannelMediaInfo(destChannelName, destChannelToken, myUid);
mediaRelayConfiguration.setDestChannelInfo(destChannelName, destChannelInfo);

// Calls startChannelMediaRelay to start relaying media streams across channels.
engine.startChannelMediaRelay(mediaRelayConfiguration);

// Calls stopChannelMediaRelay to stop relaying media streams across channels.
engine.stopChannelMediaRelay();
```

```java
// Uses the onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged callback to monitor the state of the channel media relay.
public void onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged(int state, int code) {
  switch (state){
    case RELAY_STATE_CONNECTING:
      mediaRelaying = true;
      handler.post(() ->{
        showLongToast("channel media relay connected.");
      });
      break;
    case RELAY_STATE_FAILURE:
      mediaRelaying = false;
      handler.post(() ->{
        showLongToast(String.format("channel media relay failed at error code: %d", code));
      });
  }
}
```

## Considerations

- The Agora RTC SDK supports relaying media streams to a maximum of four destination channels. To add or delete a destination channel, call `updateChannelMediaRelay`.
- This feature supports integer user IDs only.

- When setting the source channel information, ensure that you set `uid` as 0, and the `uid` that you use to generate the token should also be set as 0.

- To call `startChannelMediaRelay` again after it succeeds, you must call `stopChannelMediaRelay` to quit the current relay.
