## Introduction

To improve data security, Agora supports encrypting users' media streams during real-time engagement. You can enable the built-in encryption provided by Agora, which uses the preset encryption mode in the SDK to encrypt the media streams.

The following diagram describes the encrypted data transmission process:

## Sample project

Agora provides an open-source sample project that implements [built-in encryption](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Unity-Quickstart/tree/dev/encryption/API-Example-Unity/Assets/API-Example/encryption-sample) on GitHub. You can try the demo and view the source code.

## Implementation

Before enabling media-stream encryption, ensure that you refer to the appropriate Quickstart Guide to implement the basic real-time communication functions in your project.

Before joining a channel, call `EnableEncryption` to enable the built-in encryption.

As of v3.4.5, Agora recommends using the `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2` encryption mode and setting the key and salt.

To generate and set the `key` and `salt` parameters, refer to the following steps.

<div class="alert note"><li>All users in a channel must use the same encryption mode, key, and salt.</li>
<li>Compared to other encryption modes, the <code>GCM2</code> encryption modes use a more secure KDF (Key Derivation Function) and support setting the salt. If you choose other encryption modes, you only need to set the encryption mode and key.</li></div>


### Generate and set the key

1. Refer to the following command to randomly generate a 32-byte key in the string format through OpenSSL on your server.

 ``` shell
 // Randomly generate a 32-byte key in the string format, and pass the string key in the encryptionKey parameter of EnableEncryption.
openssl rand -hex 32
dba643c8ba6b6dc738df43d9fd624293b4b12d87a60f518253bd10ba98c48453
 ```

2. The client gets the key in the string format from the server and passes it to the SDK in the `EnableEncryption` method.

### Generate and set the salt

1. Refer to the following command to randomly generate a Base64-encoded, 32-byte salt through OpenSSL on the server. You can also refer to the [C++ sample code](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Tools/blob/master/DynamicKey/AgoraDynamicKey/cpp/sample/RtcChannelEncryptionSaltSample.cpp) provided by Agora on GitHub to randomly generate a salt in the byte array format and convert it to Base64 on the server.

 ``` shell
 // Randomly generate a 32-byte salt in the Base64 format. Convert the salt from Base64 to UTF8, and pass the UTF8 salt in the encryptionKdfSalt parameter of EnableEncryption.
X5w9T+50kzxVOnkJKiY/lUk82/bES2kATOt3vBuGEDw=
 ```

2. The client gets the Base64 salt from the server.
3. The client converts the salt from Base64 to UTF8, and then passes it to the SDK in the `EnableEncryption` method.

#### Sample code

```csharp
using System.Text;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using agora_gaming_rtc;

// Get the key and salt generated from your server.
bool GetSecretAndSaltFromSever(out string secret, out string kdfSaltBase64)

int EnableEncryption()
    {
        var secret = "";
        var kdfSaltBase64 = "";
        if (!GetSecretAndSaltFromSever(out secret, out kdfSaltBase64))
            return -1;

        if (mRtcEngine != null)
        {
            var config = new EncryptionConfig
            {
                // Set the encryption mode as AES_128_GCM2.
                encryptionMode = ENCRYPTION_MODE.AES_128_GCM2,
                // Set the key.
                encryptionKey = secret,
                /// Set the salt. You need to convert the salt from Base64 to UTF8.
                encryptionKdfSalt = Convert.FromBase64String(kdfSaltBase64)
            };
            // Enable the built-in encryption.
            return mRtcEngine.EnableEncryption(true, config);
        }

        return -1;
    }
```

## Considerations

- Both the communication and interactive live streaming scenarios support encryption, but Agora does not support pushing encrypted streams to the CDN during live streaming.
- To use media-stream encryption, you need to enable encryption before joining a channel. Ensure that both the receivers and senders use the same encryption mode; otherwise, undefined behaviors such as a black screen or audio loss occur.
- To enhance security, Agora recommends using a new key and salt every time you enable media-stream encryption.
