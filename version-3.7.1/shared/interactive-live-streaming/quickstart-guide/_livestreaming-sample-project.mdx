Agora provides an open-source [API-Examples](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/tree/master/Android) sample project on GitHub. This page describes how to run this project and experience interactive live audio or video streaming.

## Prerequisites

- Development environment requirements:
- [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Android Studio 3.0 or later
- If your network has a firewall, follow the instructions in [Firewall Requirements](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/firewall?platform=Android) to access Agora services.
- A real Android device. Agora recommends you run this sample project on a physical mobile device, as some simulators may not support the full features of this project.
- A valid [Agora account](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/sign_in_and_sign_up).

## Procedure

### 1. Create an Agora project
To create an Agora project, do the following:

1. Enter the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check **Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)** as the authentication mechanism.
4. Click **Submit**. You can now see the project on the **Project Management** page.

### 2. Get an App ID
To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532" />  icon in the App ID column.

### 3. Generate a temporary token
To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](https://docs.agora.io/en/AgoraPlatform/term_token) to authenticate users joining a channel.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTC temporary tokens. To generate an RTC temporary token:
1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, find your project and click **Config**.

2. Click **Generate temp RTC token** under **Primary Certificate**.
![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971893263)
3. Enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click **Generate**. When joining the channel later, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you enter here.

4. Click the copy icon to copy the temporary token.

<div class="alert note">Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only, and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. For details, see <a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/token_server?platform=Android">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</a>.</div>


### 4. Configure the sample project

1. Download the [API-Examples](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples) repository, and find the `API-Examples-master/Android/APIExample` sample project.
   Agora recommends that you move the `APIExample` folder to the root directory of your working disk; otherwise, the project build can fail because the project path is too long.

2. Fill in the `APIExample/app/src/main/res/values/string_config.xml` file with the App ID and temporary token generated in Agora Console.

   ```xml
   // Replace YOUR APP ID with your App ID in the string format. 
   <string name="agora_app_id" translatable="false">YOUR APP ID</string>
   // Replace YOUR ACCESS TOKEN with your temporary token in the string format.
   <string name="agora_access_token" translatable="false">YOUR ACCESS TOKEN</string>
   ```

### 5. Build and run the sample project

1. Enable **Developer options** and **USB Debugging** on your Android device, and then connect it to your computer using a USB cable.

2. Open the `APIExample` sample project with **Android Studio**. **Android Studio** automatically starts the sync with Grade files.

3. After the sync is successful, click `Run 'app'` on your **Android Studio** to install the **Agora API Example** app on your device.

4. Open the app, select **Live Interactive Audio Streaming** or **Live Interactive Video Streaming**, read the prompt, and click **Next** to join the channel.

5. Ask a friend to join the live streaming with you using the [Agora Web demo app](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/). Ensure that your friend enters the same App ID, channel name, and temporary token. You can then hear or see each other.
