Use this guide to quickly start the interactive live video streaming with the Agora Video SDK for macOS.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Interactive Live Streaming Premium functionality.

![1625465916613](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625465916613)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Interactive Live Streaming Premium in your project is as follows:

1. Set the client role
Each user in an Interactive Live Streaming Premium channel is either a host or an audience member. Hosts publish streams to the channel, and the audience subscribe to the streams.  

2. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

3. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

4. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, app clients with the role of the host can publish audio and video. For an auidence memeber to send audio and video, you can call `setClientRole` to switch the client role. 

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the live stream. 

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 11.0 or later (the interface description in this article is based on Xcode 11.0).
- A macOS device running macOS 10.10 or later.
- A valid [Agora account](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/sign_in_and_sign_up?platform=macOS).

## <a name="integrate_sdk"></a>Integrate the SDK

Choose one of the following methods to obtain the Agora macOS SDK:

<div class="alert info">If you need to integrate SDK with versions earlier than v3.2.0, see integration steps in <a href="#earlierversion">Integrate earlier versions of the SDK</a>.</div>

### Method 1: Through CocoaPods

1. Ensure that you have installed CocoaPods before the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project.

    ```shell
    # platform :macos, '10.11'
    target 'Your App' do
      pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_macOS'
    end
    ```

4. Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

### Method 2: Through the Agora website

1. Navigate to [SDK Downloads](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/downloads?platform=macOS), download the latest version of the Agora macOS SDK, and extract the files from the downloaded SDK package.

2. According to your requirements, copy the libraries from the `libs` folder of the SDK to the `./project_name` folder in your project (`project_name` is an example of your project name).

3. Open Xcode, and navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

4. Click **+** > **Add Other…** > **Add Files** to add the corresponding libraries. Ensure that the **Embed** attribute of these dynamic libraries is **Embed & Sign**.

<div class="alert note"><ul><li>According to the official requirements of Apple, the Extension of an app cannot contain the dynamic library. If you need to integrate the SDK with the dynamic library in the Extension, change the file status to <b>Do Not Embed</b>.</li><li>The Agora SDK uses libc++ (LLVM) by default. Contact support@agora.io if you want to use libstdc++ (GNU). The SDK provides FAT image libraries with multi-architecture support for both 32/64-bit audio emulators and 32/64-bit audio/video real devices.</li></ul></div>

### Method 3: Through Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode, go to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependencies...**, and paste the following URL:

   ```http
   <%= url %>
   ```

2. In **Choose Package Options**, specify the SDK version that you want to integrate. If the version number is x.y.z, fill in **x.y.z**; if the version number is x.y.z.a, fill in **x.y.z-r.a**.

<div class="alert note"><ul>
<li>For the macOS SDK, Agora provides Swift Packages as of v3.6.2.</li>
<li>If you have issues installing this Swift Package, try going to <b>File > Swift Packages > Reset Package Caches</b>.</li>
<li>Use the Swift Package Manager on a network with access to GitHub.</li>
</ul></div>

## Implementation

Once you have integrated the Agora macOS SDK into your project, you need to call the core APIs provided by the Agora macOS SDK in the `ViewController` file to implement basic interactive live video streaming. The API call sequence is shown in the following figure:

![1617275126467](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1617275126467)

### 1. Create the UI

When creating the user interface for basic interactive live video streaming, Agora recommends adding the video view of the host on both the local and remote clients. Refer to the following code samples to create a basic UI from scratch.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.h
// Import AppKit
#import &lt;AppKit/AppKit.h&gt;
@interface ViewController ()
// Defines localView
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSView *localView;
// Defines remoteView
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSView *remoteView;
@end
@implementation ViewController
...
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    ...
    // This function initializes the local and remote video views
    [self initViews];
}
// Sets the video view layout
- (void)viewDidLayout {
    [super viewDidLayout];
    self.remoteView.frame = self.view.bounds;
    self.localView.frame = CGRectMake(self.view.bounds.size.width - 90, 0, 90, 160);
}
- (void)initViews {
    // Initializes the remote video view
    // This view displays video when a remote host joins the channel
    self.remoteView = [[NSView alloc] init];
    [self.view addSubview:self.remoteView];
    // Initializes the local video view
    // This view displays video when the local user is a host
    self.localView = [[NSView alloc] init];
    [self.view addSubview:self.localView];
}
...
@end
```

#### Swift
```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Import AppKit
import AppKit
class ViewController: NSViewController {
    ...
     // Defines localView
     var localView: NSView!
     // Defines remoteView
     var remoteView: NSView!
     override func viewDidLoad() {
         ...
         // This function initializes the local and remote video views
         initView()
     }
    // Sets the video view layout
    override func viewDidLayout() {
        super.viewDidLayout()
        remoteView.frame = self.view.bounds
        localView.frame = CGRect(x: self.view.bounds.width - 90, y: 0, width: 90, height: 160)
    }
    func initView() {
        // Initializes the remote video view
        // This view displays video when a remote host joins the channel
        remoteView = NSView()
        self.view.addSubview(remoteView)
        // Initializes the local video view
        // This view displays video when the local user is a host
        localView = NSView()
        self.view.addSubview(localView)
    }
    ...
}
```

### <a name="ImportClass"></a> 2. Import the class

Before calling any Agora API, import the `AgoraRtcKit` class, and define `agoraKit`.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.h
// Imports the AgoraRtcKit class
// For SDKs earlier than 3.0.0, AgoraRtcKit is named AgoraRtcEngineKit
// If you use a SDK earlier than 3.0.0, use "#import &ltAgoraRtcEngineKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h&gt" instead
#import &ltAgoraRtcKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h&gt
// Specifies AgoraRtcEngineDelegate for monitoring a callback
@interface ViewController : NSViewController &ltAgoraRtcEngineDelegate&gt
// Defines agoraKit
@property (strong, nonatomic) AgoraRtcEngineKit *agoraKit;
```


#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Imports the AgoraRtcKit class
// For SDKs earlier than 3.0.0, AgoraRtcKit is named AgoraRtcEngineKit
// If you use a SDK earlier than 3.0.0, use "import AgoraRtcEngineKit" instead
import AgoraRtcKit
class ViewController: NSViewController {
    ...
    // Defines agoraKit
    var agoraKit: AgoraRtcEngineKit?
}
```

### 3. Initialize AgoraRtcEngineKit

Call the `sharedEngineWithAppId` method to create and initialize the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object.

When adding the following code in your project, replace `YourAppID` with the App ID of your project. See [Get an App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/run_demo_video_call_macos?platform=macOS#appid).

If you want to monitor a callback for your app scenario, register it when initializing `AgoraRtcEngineKit`.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
self.agoraKit = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:@"YourAppID" delegate:self];
```

#### Swift

```swift
<pre class="swift"><code class="language-swift">// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
agoraKit = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(withAppId: "YourAppID", delegate: self)
```

### 4. Set the channel profile

Call the `setChannelProfile` method to set the channel profile as `LiveBroadcasting`.

Each `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object supports one profile only. If you want to switch to another profile, destroy the current `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object with `destroy`, and create a new one with `sharedEngineWithAppId`; then, call `setChannelProfile` again.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
[self.agoraKit setChannelProfile:AgoraChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting];
```


#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
agoraKit?.setChannelProfile(.liveBroadcasting)
```

### 5. Set the client role

An interactive live streaming channel has two client roles: `Broadcaster` and `Audience`; the default role is `Audience`. After setting the channel profile to `LiveBroadcasting`, set the client role using the following steps:

1. Ask the user to choose a client role.
2. Call the `setClientRole` method, and pass in the client role set by the user.

Note that in interactive live streaming, only the host can be seen and heard. If you want to switch the client role after joining the channel, call the `setClientRole` method again.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// Sets the client role as the host
[self.agoraKit setClientRole:AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// Sets the client role as the host
agoraKit?.setClientRole(.broadcaster)
```

### 6. Set the local video view

Set the local video view before joining a channel so that hosts can see themselves during live video streaming. Refer to the following steps to set the local video view for a host:

1. Call the `enableVideo` method to enable the video module.
2. Call the `setupLocalVideo` method to configure the local video display settings.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// Enables the video module
[self.agoraKit enableVideo];
AgoraRtcVideoCanvas *videoCanvas = [[AgoraRtcVideoCanvas alloc] init];
videoCanvas.uid = 0;
videoCanvas.renderMode = AgoraVideoRenderModeHidden;
videoCanvas.view = self.localView;
// Sets the local video view
[self.agoraKit setupLocalVideo:videoCanvas];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// Enables the video module
agoraKit?.enableVideo()
let videoCanvas = AgoraRtcVideoCanvas()
videoCanvas.uid = 0
videoCanvas.renderMode = .hidden
videoCanvas.view = localView
// Sets the local video view
agoraKit?.setupLocalVideo(videoCanvas)
```

### <a name="JoinChannel"></a>7. Join a channel

Call the `joinChannelByToken` method to join a channel. When adding the following code in your project, replace `YourToken` with the token of your project, and replace `YourChannelName` with the channel name used to generate the token of your project.

- For testing, you can [generate a temporary token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/run_demo_video_call_macos?platform=macOS#temptoken) in Agora Console.
- For production, Agora recommends using a token generated at your server. See [Generate a Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/token_server?platform=macOS).

<div class="alert note">By default, a user who has joined a channel subscribes to the audio and video streams of all the other users in the channel. This will generate usage and affect billing. If you do not want to subscribe to a specific stream or all remote streams, call the <tt>mute</tt> methods accordingly.</div>

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// The uid of each user in the channel must be unique.
[self.agoraKit joinChannelByToken:@"YourToken" channelId:@"YourChannelName" info:nil uid:0 joinSuccess:^(NSString * _Nonnull channel, NSUInteger uid, NSInteger elapsed) {
}];
```


#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// The uid of each user in the channel must be unique.
agoraKit?.joinChannel(byToken: "YourToken", channelId: "YourChannelName", info: nil, uid: 0, joinSuccess: { (channel, uid, elapsed) in
})
```

### 8. Set the remote video view

In interactive live video streaming, you should be able to see all hosts.

To set the video view of a remote host, monitor the `didJoinedOfUid` callback, which returns the remote host's ID shortly after the remote host joins the channel; then, call the `setupRemoteVideo` method in the callback, and pass in the retrieved `uid`.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Monitors the didJoinedOfUid callback
// The SDK triggers the callback when a remote host joins the channel
- (void)rtcEngine:(AgoraRtcEngineKit *)engine didJoinedOfUid:(NSUInteger)uid elapsed:(NSInteger)elapsed {
    AgoraRtcVideoCanvas *videoCanvas = [[AgoraRtcVideoCanvas alloc] init];
    videoCanvas.uid = uid;
    videoCanvas.renderMode = AgoraVideoRenderModeHidden;
    videoCanvas.view = self.remoteView;
    // Sets the remote video view
    [self.agoraKit setupRemoteVideo:videoCanvas];
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Specifies AgoraRtcEngineDelegate for monitoring a callback
extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {
    // Monitors the didJoinedOfUid callback
    // The SDK triggers the callback when a remote host joins the channel
    func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, didJoinedOfUid uid: UInt, elapsed: Int) {
        let videoCanvas = AgoraRtcVideoCanvas()
        videoCanvas.uid = uid
        videoCanvas.renderMode = .hidden
        videoCanvas.view = remoteView
        // Sets the remote video view
        agoraKit?.setupRemoteVideo(videoCanvas)
    }
}
```

### 9. Leave the channel

Call the `leaveChannel` method when you need to leave the channel, for example, to end interactive live video streaming, close the app, or run the app in the background.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
[self.agoraKit leaveChannel:nil];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
agoraKit?.leaveChannel(nil)
```


### 10. Destroy AgoraRtcEngineKit

After leaving the channel, if you want to release all resources used by the Agora SDK, call the `destroy` method to destroy the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
[AgoraRtcEngineKit destroy];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()
```

<a name="project_setting"></a>

## Run the project

Before running the project, you need to set your signing and team, and add device permissions.

### 1. Set your signing and team

1. In Xcode, navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Signing**, and choose **Automatically manage signing**.
2. Read the prompts carefully, and click **Enable Automatic**.
3. After you successfully set your signing, choose a developer in **Team**.

### 2. Add device permissions

1. In Xcode, open the `info.plist` file. Add the following contents to add permissions for your device:

| Key                                    | Type   | Value                                                        |
| :------------------------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Privacy - Microphone Usage Description | String | The purpose for accessing the microphone, such as for a call or interactive live streaming. |
| Privacy - Camera Usage Description     | String | The purpose for accessing the camera, such as for a call or interactive live streaming. |

2. Navigate to **TARGETS** > **Project Name** > **Signing & Capabilities**, and add the following permissions in **App Sandbox** and **Hardened Runtime**:

| Capability       | Category        | Permission                                                 |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| App Sandbox      | Network         | <ul><li>Incoming Connections (Server)</li><li>Outgoing Connections (Client)</li></ul> |
| App Sandbox      | Hardware        | <ul><li>Camera</li><li>Audio Input</li></ul>                                          |
| Hardened Runtime | Resource Access | <ul><li>Camera</li><li>Audio Input</li></ul>                                          |

 <div class="alert note"><ul><li>If you need to add a third-party plug-in or library (such as a third-party camera), and the signing of the third-party plug-in or library is different from your project, you need to navigate to <b>Hardened Runtime</b> > <b>Runtime Exceptions</b>, and check the <b>Disable Library Validation</b> option.</li><li>See more considerations in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing_your_app_for_distribution">Preparing Your App for Distribution</a >.</li></ul></div>
 
 
3. In Xcode 12.2 and later, to avoid compliation errors, you need to navigate to **TARGETS** > **Project Name** > **Build Settings** > **Architectures**, and set the **Architectures** property to **x86_64** before the compilation.


### 3. Try the interactive live video streaming

Agora recommends running the project on a real device instead of a simulator. If your app is installed and running successfully, hosts should see the video view of themselves.

To test the remote video view of the host, visit the [Web Demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/), and enter the same App ID, channel name, and token to join the same channel. If interactive live video streaming runs successfully, a host should see both the local video view and video views of other hosts; an audience member should see video views of hosts.

## Integrate earlier versions of the SDK

Choose one of the following methods to integrate a version of the Agora macOS SDK earlier than v3.2.0.

### Method 1: Through CocoaPods

1. Ensure that you have installed CocoaPods before performing the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.


3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project and replace `version` with the version of the SDK that you want to integrate. For information about the SDK version, see [Release Notes](./release_mac_video?platform=macOS).


 ```
# platform :macos, '10.11'
target 'Your App' do
  pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_macOS', 'version'
end
```

4. Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

### Method 2: Through your local storage

You need to use different integration methods to integrate different versions of the SDK. Click the following version categories to expand the corresponding integration steps.
