People engage longer when they see, hear, and interact with each other. The Agora SDK enables you to embed real-time voice and video interaction in any app, on any device, anywhere.

This page shows the minimum code you need to add interactive live streaming into your app by using the Agora Video SDK.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Interactive Live Streaming Premium functionality.

![1625465916613](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625465916613)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Interactive Live Streaming Premium in your project is as follows:

1. Set the client role
Each user in an Interactive Live Streaming Premium channel is either a host or an audience member. Hosts publish streams to the channel, and the audience subscribe to the streams.

2. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

3. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

4. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, app clients with the role of the host can publish audio and video. For an auidence memeber to send audio and video, you can call `setClientRole` to switch the client role.

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the live stream.

## Implement the interactive live streaming

This section introduces how to use the Agora SDK to start the interactive live streaming. The following figure shows the API call sequence of the live streaming.

![1651832385847](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1651832385847)

### 1. Create the UI

Create the user interface (UI) for the one-to-one video call in your project. Skip to [Import the SDK](#import) if you already have a UI in your project.

If you are implementing an interactive video streaming, we recommend adding the following elements into the UI:
- The view of the host
- The exit button

<a name="import"></a>

### 2. Import the SDK

Add the following line to import the Agora SDK:

```csharp
using agora.rtc;
```

### 3. Inherit IAgoraRtcEngineEventHandler

The C# SDK is developed upon C++. In this step, we create an `AgoraRtcEventHandler` class from `IAgoraRtcEngineEventHandler` for managing callback events:

```csharp
class AgoraRtcEventHandler : IAgoraRtcEngineEventHandler
{
      public AgoraRtcEventHandler()
      {

      }
};
```

### 4. Initialize IRtcEngine

Create and initialize the `IAgoraRtcEngine` object before calling any other Agora APIs.

Call the `CreateAgoraRtcEngine` and `Initialize` methods, and pass in the App ID to initialize the `IAgoraRtcEngine` object.

You can also listen for callback events, such as when the local user joins or leaves the channel.

```csharp
// Declare variables
IAgoraRtcEngine rtc_engine_ = null;
IAgoraRtcEngineEventHandler event_handler_ = null;

if (null == rtc_engine_)
{
    // Create rtc engine
    rtc_engine_ = AgoraRtcEngine.CreateAgoraRtcEngine();
}

RtcEngineContext context = new RtcEngineContext(appId);
// Initialize rtc engine
int ret = rtc_engine_.Initialize(context);
event_handler_ = new AgoraRtcEventHandler();

// Initialize the engine event handler
rtc_engine_.InitEventHandler(event_handler_);

// Enable video
rtc_engine_.EnableVideo();
```

### 5. Set the channel profile

After initializing the `IAgoraRtcEngine` object, call the `SetChannelProfile` method to set the channel profile as `LIVE_BROADCASTING`.

One `IAgoraRtcEngine` object uses one profile only. If you want to switch to another profile, release the current `IAgoraRtcEngine` object with the release method and create a new one before calling the `SetChannelProfile` method.

```csharp
rtc_engine_.SetChannelProfile(CHANNEL_PROFILE_TYPE.CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING);
```

### 6. Set the client role

A `LIVE_BROADCASTING` channel has two client roles: `BROADCASTER` and `AUDIENCE`, and the default role is `AUDIENCE`. After setting the channel profile to `LIVE_BROADCASTING`, your app may use the following steps to set the client role:

- Allow the user to set the role as `BROADCASTER` or `AUDIENCE`.
- Call the `SetClientRole` method and pass in the client role set by the user.

Note that in the interactive live streaming, only the host can be heard and seen. If you want to switch the client role after joining the channel, call the `SetClientRole` method.

```csharp
rtc_engine_.SetClientRole(CLIENT_ROLE_TYPE.CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER);
```


### 7. Set the local video view

After initializing the `IAgoraRtcEngine` object, set the local video view before joining the channel so that hosts can see themselves.

```csharp
VideoCanvas vs = new VideoCanvas((ulong)localWindowId.Handle, RENDER_MODE_TYPE.RENDER_MODE_FIT);
rtc_engine_.SetupLocalVideo(vs);
```

### 8. Join a channel

After initializing the `IAgoraRtcEngine` object and setting the local video view, you can call the `joinChannel` method to join a live streaming channel. In this method, set the following parameters:

- `channelName`: Specify the channel name that you want to join.

* `token`: Pass a token that identifies the role and privilege of the user.  You can set it as one of the following values:
  * A temporary token generated in Console. A temporary token is valid for 24 hours. For details, see [Get a Temporary Token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token). When joining a channel, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you use to generate the temporary token.
  * A token generated at the server. This applies to scenarios with high-security requirements. For details, see [Generate a token from Your Server](../basic-features/token-server). When joining a channel, ensure that the channel name and `uid` is the same with those you use to generate the token.

 <div class="alert note"><ul><li>If your project has enabled the app certificate, ensure that you provide a token.</li><li>Ensure that you do not set <code>token</code> as "".</li></ul></div>


- `uid`: ID of the local user that is an integer and should be unique. If you set `uid` as 0,  the SDK assigns a user ID for the local user and returns it in the `OnJoinChannelSuccess` callback.
  <div class="alert note">Once the user joins the channel, the user subscribes to the audio and video streams of all the other users in the channel by default, giving rise to usage and billing calculation. If you do not want to subscribe to a specified stream or all remote streams, call the <code>mute</code> methods accordingly.</div>


```csharp
rtc_engine_.JoinChannel("", "testChannelId","", 0, new ChannelMediaOptions(true, true, true, true));
```

### 9. Set the remote video view

In a video streaming, you should be able to see all the hosts, regardless of your role. This is achieved by calling the `SetupRemoteVideo` method after joining the channel.

Shortly after a remote host joins the channel, the SDK gets the host's ID in the `OnUserJoined` callback. Call the `SetupRemoteVideo` method in the callback, and pass in the `uid` to set the video view of the remote host.

```csharp
// Call SetupRemoteVideo to set the remote video view
VideoCanvas  vc = new VideoCanvas((ulong)remoteWindowId,
RENDER_MODE_TYPE.RENDER_MODE_FIT, "testChannelId", remoteUid);
rtc_engine_.SetupRemoteVideo(vc);
```

### 10. Leave the channel

Call the `LeaveChannel` method to leave the current channel according to your scenario, for example, when the interactive streaming ends, when you need to close the app, or when your app runs in the background.

```csharp
rtc_engine_.LeaveChannel();
```


## Run the project

After building the app, follow the steps to add the necessary libraries to the execution path:

- For `.netcore` 64-bit apps, copy all the libraries under `netCore/x86_64`.
- For `.netframework` 32-bit apps, copy all the libraries under `netFramework/x86`.

Run the project on your Windows device. When you set the role as the host and successfully start the interactive video streaming, you can see the video view of yourself in the app. When you set the role as the audience and successfully join the interactive video streaming, you can see the video view of the host in the app.
