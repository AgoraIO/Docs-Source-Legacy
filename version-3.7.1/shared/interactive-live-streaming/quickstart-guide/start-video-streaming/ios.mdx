The Agora Video SDK for iOS makes it easy to embed real-time voice and video interaction into iOS apps. It enables you to develop rapidly and easily to enhance your social, work, education and IoT apps with face-to-face interaction.

This page shows the minimum code you need to add interactive live video streaming into your app by using the Agora Video SDK for iOS.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Interactive Live Streaming Premium functionality.

![1625465916613](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625465916613)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Interactive Live Streaming Premium in your project is as follows:

1. Set the client role
Each user in an Interactive Live Streaming Premium channel is either a host or an audience member. Hosts publish streams to the channel, and the audience subscribe to the streams.  

2. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

3. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

4. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, app clients with the role of the host can publish audio and video. For an auidence memeber to send audio and video, you can call `setClientRole` to switch the client role. 

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the live stream. 

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- Xcode 9.0 or later.
- An iOS device running iOS 9.0 or later.
- A valid [Agora account](https://console.agora.io/).
- A valid Agora project with an App ID and a temporary token. For details, see [Get Started with Agora](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms).
- A computer with access to the internet. If your network has a firewall, follow the instructions in [Firewall Requirements](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/firewall?platform=All%20Platforms).

## Project setup

In Xcode, follow the steps to create the environment necessary to add interactive live video streaming into your app.

1. Create a new iOS app and configure the following settings:
   - **Product Name**: Any name you like.
   - **Team**: If you have added a team, choose it from the pop-up menu. If not, you can see the **Add account** button. Click it, input your Apple ID, and click **Next** to add your team.
   - **Organization Identifier**: The identifier of your organization. If you do not belong to an organization, use any identifier you like.
   - **Interface**: Choose **Storyboard**.
   - **Language**: Choose **Swift**.

2. Integrate the Video SDK into your project:

   Go to **File** > **Swift Packages** > **Add Package Dependencies...**, and paste the following URL:
	 
	 ```http
	 https://github.com/AgoraIO/AgoraRtcEngine_iOS
	 ```
 
   In **Choose Package Options**, specify the Video SDK version you want to use. You need to fill in x.y.z for version x.y.z and x.y.z-r.a for version x.y.z.a. For example, fill in 3.5.0 for version 3.5.0 and 3.5.0-r.2 for version 3.5.0.2.

   - Privacy - Microphone Usage Description
   - Privacy - Camera Usage Description


## Implement a client for interactive live video streaming

This section shows how to use the Agora Video SDK to implement interactive live video streaming in your app step by step.

### Create the UI

In the interface, you should have one frame for local video and another for remote video. In `ViewController.swift`, replace any existing content with the following:

```swift
import UIKit
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var localView: UIView!
    var remoteView: UIView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        initView()
     }
  
    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {
        super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()
        remoteView.frame = self.view.bounds
        localView.frame = CGRect(x: self.view.bounds.width - 90, y: 0, width: 90, height: 160)
    }
  
    func initView() {
        remoteView = UIView()
        self.view.addSubview(remoteView)
        localView = UIView()
        self.view.addSubview(localView)
    }
}
```

### Implement the interactive live video streaming logic

When your app opens, you create an `RtcEngine` instance, enable the video, join a channel, and if the local user is a host, publish the local video to the lower frame layout in the UI. When another host joins the channel, your app catches the join event and adds the remote video to the top frame layout in the UI.

The following figure shows the API call sequence of implementing interactive live video streaming: 

![1627888336100](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1627888336100)

To implement this logic, take the following steps:

1. Import the Agora kit and add the `agoraKit` variable.
   Modify your  `ViewController.swift` as follows:

   ```swift
   import UIKit
   // Add this line to import the Agora kit 
   import AgoraRtcKit
   class ViewController: UIViewController {
       var localView: UIView!
       var remoteView: UIView!
       // Add this line to add the agoraKit variable
       var agoraKit: AgoraRtcEngineKit?
   }
   
   override func viewDidLoad() {
              super.viewDidLoad()
              initView()
           }
   ```

2. Initialize the app and join the channel.

   Call the core methods to initialize the app and join a channel. In this example app, this functionality is encapsulated in the `initializeAndJoinChannel` function.

   In `ViewController.swift`, add the following lines after the `initView` function, and fill in your App ID, temporary token, and channel name:

   ```swift
    func initializeAndJoinChannel() {
      // Pass in your App ID here
      agoraKit = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(withAppId: "Your App ID", delegate: self)
      // For a live streaming scenario, set the channel profile as liveBroadcasting.
      agoraKit?.setChannelProfile(.liveBroadcasting)
      // Set the client role as broadcaster or audience.
      agoraKit?.setClientRole(.broadcaster)
      // Video is disabled by default. You need to call enableVideo to start a video stream.
      agoraKit?.enableVideo()
           // Create a videoCanvas to render the local video
           let videoCanvas = AgoraRtcVideoCanvas()
           videoCanvas.uid = 0
           videoCanvas.renderMode = .hidden
           videoCanvas.view = localView
           agoraKit?.setupLocalVideo(videoCanvas)
      
      // Join the channel with a token. Pass in your token and channel name here
      agoraKit?.joinChannel(byToken: "Your token", channelId: "Channel name", info: nil, uid: 0, joinSuccess: { (channel, uid, elapsed) in
           })
       }
   ```

3. Add the remote interface when a remote host joins the channel.

   In `ViewController.swift`, add the following lines after the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {
        // This callback is triggered when a remote host joins the channel
        func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, didJoinedOfUid uid: UInt, elapsed: Int) {
            let videoCanvas = AgoraRtcVideoCanvas()
            videoCanvas.uid = uid
            videoCanvas.renderMode = .hidden
            videoCanvas.view = remoteView
            agoraKit?.setupRemoteVideo(videoCanvas)
        }
    }
    ```

### Start and stop your app

Now you have created the interactive live video streaming functionality, add the functionality of starting and stopping the app. In this implementation, a live stream starts when the user opens your app and ends when the user closes your app.

To implement the functionality of starting and stopping the app:

1. When the view is loaded, call `initializeAndJoinChannel` to join a live streaming channel.

   In `ViewController.swift`, add the `initializeAndJoinChannel` function inside the `viewDidLoad` function:

    ```swift
   override func viewDidLoad() {
           super.viewDidLoad()
           initView()
           // Add this line
           initializeAndJoinChannel()
        }
    ```
   
2. When the user closes this app, clean up all the resources used by your app.

   In `ViewController.swift`, add `viewDidDisappear` after the `initializeAndJoinChannel` function.

    ```swift
   override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
        agoraKit?.leaveChannel(nil)
        AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()
	}
    ```

## Test your app

To test your app on a physical device, do the following:

1. Check whether you fill in your App ID, temporary token, and channel name in `ViewController.swift`.
2. Connect an iOS device to your computer.
3. In Xcode, choose the device from the scheme menu in the [toolbar](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devf0d1df47a), and click the Run button.
4. On your device, launch the app and grant microphone and camera access.
   You can see yourself on the local view.
5. Ask a friend to join the live stream with you on the [demo app](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicLive/index.html). Your friend needs to enter the same App ID and channel name.
   If your friend joins as a host, you should be able to see and hear each other; if as an audience member, you should only be able to see yourself while your friend can see and hear you.

## Next steps

Generating a token by hand is not helpful in a production context. [Authenticate Your Users with Tokens](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/token_server?platform=All%20Platforms) shows you how to start live streaming with a token that you retrieve from your server.

### Objective-C code sample

To implement interactive live video streaming in your app using Objective-C:

1. Replace the contents in the  `ViewController.h` file with the following:

   ```objective-c
   #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
   
   #import <AgoraRtcKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h>
   
   @interface ViewController : UIViewController <AgoraRtcEngineDelegate>
   @property (strong, nonatomic) AgoraRtcEngineKit *agoraKit;
   
   @end
   ```

2. Replace the contents in the `ViewController.m` file with the following:

   ```objective-c
   #import "ViewController.h"
   #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
   
   @interface ViewController ()
   @property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *localView;
   @property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *remoteView;
   @end
   
   @implementation ViewController
   - (void)viewDidLoad {
       [super viewDidLoad];
       [self initViews];
       [self initializeAndJoinChannel];
   }
   
   - (void)viewDidLayoutSubviews {
       [super viewDidLayoutSubviews];
       self.remoteView.frame = self.view.bounds;
       self.localView.frame = CGRectMake(self.view.bounds.size.width - 90, 0, 90, 160);
   }
   
   - (void)initViews {
       self.remoteView = [[UIView alloc] init];
       [self.view addSubview:self.remoteView];
       self.localView = [[UIView alloc] init];
       [self.view addSubview:self.localView];
   }
   
   - (void)initializeAndJoinChannel {
       // Pass in your App ID here
       self.agoraKit = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:@"Your App ID" delegate:self];
       [self.agoraKit setChannelProfile:AgoraChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting];
       [self.agoraKit setClientRole:AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster];
       [self.agoraKit enableVideo];
       AgoraRtcVideoCanvas *videoCanvas = [[AgoraRtcVideoCanvas alloc] init];
       videoCanvas.uid = 0;
       videoCanvas.renderMode = AgoraVideoRenderModeHidden;
       videoCanvas.view = self.localView;
       [self.agoraKit setupLocalVideo:videoCanvas];
       // Pass in your token and channel name here
       [self.agoraKit joinChannelByToken:@"Your token" channelId:@"Channel name" info:nil uid:0 joinSuccess:^(NSString * _Nonnull channel, NSUInteger uid, NSInteger elapsed) {
       }];
   }
   
   - (void)rtcEngine:(AgoraRtcEngineKit *)engine didJoinedOfUid:(NSUInteger)uid elapsed:(NSInteger)elapsed {
       AgoraRtcVideoCanvas *videoCanvas = [[AgoraRtcVideoCanvas alloc] init];
       videoCanvas.uid = uid;
       videoCanvas.renderMode = AgoraVideoRenderModeHidden;
       videoCanvas.view = self.remoteView;
       [self.agoraKit setupRemoteVideo:videoCanvas];
   }
   
   - (void)viewDidDisappear:(BOOL)animated {
     [super viewDidDisappear:animated];
     [self.agoraKit leaveChannel:nil];
     [AgoraRtcEngineKit destroy];
   }
   @end
	```

### Listening for audience events

The Agora Video SDK does not report events of an audience member in a live streaming channel. Refer to [How can I listen for an audience joining or leaving an interactive live streaming channel](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/faq/audience_event) if your scenario requires so.
