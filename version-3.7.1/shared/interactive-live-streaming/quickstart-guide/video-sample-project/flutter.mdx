### Other prerequisites

A valid Agora [developer account](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/sign_in_and_sign_up).

## Procedure

### 1. Create an Agora project

To create an Agora project, do the following:

1. Enter the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check **Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)** as the authentication mechanism.
4. Click **Submit**. You can now see the project on the **Project Management** page.

### 2. Get an App ID

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532" />  icon in the App ID column.


<div class="alert info">You must specify the App ID when running the project.</div>

### 3. Generate a temporary token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](https://docs.agora.io/en/AgoraPlatform/term_token) to authenticate users joining a channel.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTC temporary tokens. To generate an RTC temporary token:
1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, find your project and click **Config**.
  ![1641971834422](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971834422) 
2. Click **Generate temp RTC token** under **Primary Certificate**.
  ![1641971893263](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971893263)
3. Enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click **Generate**. When joining the channel later, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you enter here.

4. Click the copy icon to copy the temporary token. 
 <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649997750496" />

<div class="alert note">Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only, and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. For details, see <a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/token_server?platform=Android">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</a>.</div>


<div class="alert info">You must specify the Token when running the project.</div>

### 4. Run the project

1. Download the [Agora-Flutter-SDK](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Flutter-SDK) repository. Open `agora.config.dart` (`example/lib/config/agora.config.dart`) and edit the following values:

	- Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your Agora App ID. The data type is String.
	- Replace `YOUR_TOEKN` with your Token. The data type is String.
	- Replace `YOUR_CHANNEL_ID` with your RTC channel ID. The data type is String, such as `"test_channel"`.
	- Replace `YOUR_UID` with your RTC uid, which must be the same as the uid used to generate the token. The data type is Int, such as `1234`ã€‚
	- Replace `YOUR_STRING_UID` with an empty string.

	```dart
	/// Get your own App ID at https://dashboard.agora.io/
	const appId = YOUR_APP_ID;

	/// Please refer to https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token
	const token =  YOUR_TOEKN;

	/// Your channel ID
	const channelId = YOUR_CHANNEL_ID;

	/// Your int user ID
	const uid = YOUR_UID;

	/// Your string user ID
	const stringUid = YOUR_STRING_UID;
	```

2. Run the following command to install dependencies.

	 ```bash
   flutter packages get
	 ```

3. Choose the device to run your project on and run the project. 

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
