Agora provides an open-source [API-Examples](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples) sample project on GitHub. This page introduces how to run this project and experience a live video streaming implemented by the Agora SDK.

## Prerequisites


- Xcode 9.0 or later
- An iOS device running iOS 9.0 or later.
- A valid [Agora account](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/sign_in_and_sign_up).
- Valid developer signature and device permission [settings](.#project_setting).

## Procedures

### 1. Create an Agora project

To create an Agora project, do the following:

1. Enter the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check **Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)** as the authentication mechanism.
4. Click **Submit**. You can now see the project on the **Project Management** page.

### 2. <a name="appid"></a>Get an App ID

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532" />  icon in the App ID column.


### 3. <a name="temptoken"></a>Generate a temporary token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](https://docs.agora.io/en/AgoraPlatform/term_token) to authenticate users joining a channel.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTC temporary tokens. To generate an RTC temporary token:
1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, find your project and click **Config**.
  ![1641971834422](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971834422) 
2. Click **Generate temp RTC token** under **Primary Certificate**.
  ![1641971893263](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971893263)
3. Enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click **Generate**. When joining the channel later, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you enter here.

4. Click the copy icon to copy the temporary token.

<div class="alert note">Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only, and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. For details, see <a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/token_server?platform=Android">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</a>.</div>


### 4. Configure the sample project

Download the latest [Video SDK](./downloads?platform=iOS), and fill in the `samples/APIExample/APIExample/Common/KeyCenter.swift` file with the App ID and temporary token generated in Agora Console.

  ```swift
  struct KeyCenter {
      // Replace #Your App Id# with your App ID, and add quotation marks around it, such as "xxxxxx"
      static let AppId: String = <#Your App Id#>
      // Replace #Temp Access Token# with your temporary Token, and add quotation marks around it, such as "xxxxxx"
      static var Token: String? = <#Temp Access Token#>
  }
  ```


### 5. Integrate the Agora SDK

Run `pod install` in the `samples/API-Example` directory, and wait for the installation to complete.

### 6. Compile and run the sample project

1. Connect your computer to an iOS device, click on the `APIExample.xcworkspace` file to open the `API-Example` project with Xcode, and check your iOS device in the **iOS Device** option.

    <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1639710570014" width="200"/>

2. In **Signing & Capabilities** under the project **TARGETS**, check **Automatically manage signing**, and configure your Apple developer account and **Bundle Identifier**.

3. Click <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1639710560035" width="25"/> to start compiling.

4. When the compilation is successful, the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1640600081300" width="30"/> app appears on your iOS device. You can open the app after you set it as a app from a trusted developer in your iOS system settings.

5. Once you open the app, click **Join a channel (Video)**, enter the channel name that you used to generate the temporary token, such as `test`, and click **Join**.

    <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1639710595513" width="193"/>


You can now start interactive live video streaming as `local host`. You can invite your friend to join your live channel as `remote host` through the [Agora Web sample app](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) using the same App ID, channel name, and temporary token.
