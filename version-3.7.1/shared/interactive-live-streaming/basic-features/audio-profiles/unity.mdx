## Introduction

High-fidelity audio is essential for professional audio scenarios, such as for podcasts and singing competitions. For example, podcasts require stereo and high-fidelity audio. High-fidelity audio refers to an audio profile with a sample rate of 48 kHz and a bitrate of 128 Kbps.

To obtain high-fidelity audio during real-time communications, you can choose the appropriate audio profile based on the audio quality, channel, and scenario.

## Implementation

BeforeÂ setting the audio profile, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions in your project. For details, see [Start a Voice Call](start_call_audio_unity) or [Start Live Interactive Streaming](../quickstart-guide/start-audio-streaming).

The Agora SDK provides the `SetAudioProfile` method to set the appropriate audio profile according to the scenario.

### API call sequence

The following diagram shows how to set the audio profile:

### Parameters and applications

You can set the profile and scenario parameters based on the requirements of different applications, such as the audio quality and the audio player.

You can also set the profile and scenario parameters based on different applications.

| Applications | profile | scenario | Features |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| One-to-one classroom | DEFAULT | DEFAULT | Prioritizes the call quality with smooth transmission and high-fidelity audio. |
| Battle royale game | SPEECH_STANDARD | CHATROOM_GAMING | Noise reduction and transmits the voice only. Reduces the transmission rate and suitable for multiplayer games. |
| Murder mystery game | MUSIC_STANDARD | CHATROOM_<br/>ENTERTAINMENT | High-fidelity audio encoding and decoding. No volume or audio quality change when you mute/unmute the microphone. |
| KTV | MUSIC_HIGH_<br/>QUALITY | GAME_STREAMING | High-fidelity audio and effects. Adapts to the high-fidelity audio application. |
| Podcast | MUSIC_HIGH_<br/>QUALITY_STEREO | SHOWROOM | High-fidelity audio and stereo panning. Support for professional audio hardware. |
| Music education | MUSIC_STANDARD_<br/>STEREO | GAME_STREAMING | Prioritizes audio quality. Suitable for transmitting live external audio effects. |
| Collaborative teaching | MUSIC_STANDARD_<br/>STEREO | CHATROOM_<br/>ENTERTAINMENT | High-fidelity audio and effects. No volume or audio quality change when you mute/unmute the microphone. |

### Sample code

```csharp
// FM high-fidelity
mRtcEngine.SetAudioProfile(AUDIO_PROFILE_TYPE.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY_STEREO, AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE.AUDIO_SCENARIO_SHOWROOM);

// Gaming
mRtcEngine.SetAudioProfile(AUDIO_PROFILE_TYPE.AUDIO_PROFILE_SPEECH_STANDARD, AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE.AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHATROOM_GAMING);

// Entertainment
mRtcEngine.SetAudioProfile(AUDIO_PROFILE_TYPE.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD, AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE.AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHATROOM_ENTERTAINMENT);

// KTV
mRtcEngine.SetAudioProfile(AUDIO_PROFILE_TYPE.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY, AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE.AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHATROOM_ENTERTAINMENT);
```

### API reference

- [`SetAudioProfile`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/unity/classagora__gaming__rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#adc5817c5d668f631123a643817cf3059)

## Considerations

Call this method before calling the [`JoinChannelByKey`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/unity/classagora__gaming__rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a5997a90398afe355d4d509a2a83a9999) method.

When you set the volume of a device, you can set either the in-call volume or the media volume.
- You can set the in-call volume during an audio or video call.
- You can set the media volume when you play video, games, or background music.

The differences between the two types of volumes are as follows:
- The in-call volume cannot be set as 0.
- The media volume can be set as 0.

The audio scenarios in the `SetAudioProfile` method use different volume settings.

<table>
<tr>
<th> Audio scenario</th>
<th>Volume setting</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GAME_STREAMING</td>
<td>All users use the media volume.</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
<td>DEFAULT</td>
<td  rowspan="3">	<li>In the Communication profile, all users use the in-call volume.</li>
	<li>In the Live-broadcast profile, the hosts use the in-call volume, while the audience use the media volume.</li></td>
</tr>
		<tr>
<td>EDUCATION</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SHOWROOM</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
<td>CHATROOM_ENTERTAINMENT</td>
	<td>All users use the in-call volume.</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
<td>CHATROOM_GAMING</td>
	<td>All users use the in-call volume.</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
<td>IOT</td>
	<td>All users use the in-call volume.</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
<td>MEETING</td>
	<td>All users use the media volume.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Given the system restrictions, the media volume can be set as 0, but not the in-call volume. Therefore, if you want to adjust the volume to 0, ensure that you set an audio scenario that uses the media volume.
