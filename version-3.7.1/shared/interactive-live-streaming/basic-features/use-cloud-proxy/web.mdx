## Introduction

Enterprises with high-security requirements usually have firewalls that restrict employees from visiting unauthorized sites to protect internal information.

To ensure that enterprise users can connect to Agora's services through a firewall, Agora provides the cloud proxy service.

<div class="alert info"><li>When using the cloud proxy service, Agora recommends using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</li><li>The cloud proxy service is not supported on mobile devices.</li></div>


## Working principles


The following figure shows the working principles of the Agora cloud proxy service.

![1569400862850](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1569400862850)

1. Before connecting to Agora SD-RTN™, the SDK sends the request to the cloud proxy service.
2. The cloud proxy service sends back the proxy information.
3. The SDK sends the data to the cloud proxy service, and the cloud proxy service forwards the data to Agora SD-RTN™.
4. Agora SD-RTN™ sends the data to the cloud proxy service, and the cloud proxy service forwards the data to the SDK.

## Implementation

### v3.4.0 or later

The Web SDK v3.4.0 optimizes the Agora cloud proxy architecture and enhances its connectivity in environments with restricted network access. The optimized Agora cloud proxy service also supports regional connection. If you use the Web SDK v3.4.0 or later (the 4.x not included), follow these steps to set up a cloud proxy service:

#### 1. Apply for the cloud proxy

Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) and provide the following information:
- Your App ID
- The regions using the cloud proxy
- Concurrent scale 
- Network operators

#### 2. Use the cloud proxy on the client

Before joining a channel, call the `startProxyServer` method to use the cloud proxy service and set `type` as `3`, and then test if the audio call and video call or the live streaming works. 

<div class="alert info">Ensure that you refer to the appropriate Quickstart Guide to enable basic audio and video or live streaming functions.</div> 

```js
var client = AgoraRTC.createClient({mode: 'live',codec: 'vp8'});
 
// Use the cloud proxy.
client.startProxyServer(3);
// Join a channel.
client.init(key, function() {
    client.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
      /** ... **/
    })
})
```

#### 3. Stop using the cloud proxy on the client

To stop using the cloud proxy, call the `stopProxyServer` method after leaving the channel.

```js
// After using the cloud proxy and joining the channel.
/** ... **/
// Leave the channel and disable the cloud proxy.
client.leave(()=>{
	client.stopProxyServer()
})
 
// Join the channel.
client.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
 /** ... **/
}
```

###  v2.5.1 to v3.3.1

If you use any version between the Web SDK v2.5.1 to v3.3.1, follow these steps to set up a cloud proxy service:

#### 1. Apply for the cloud proxy

Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) and provide the following information:
- Your App ID
- The regions using the cloud proxy
- Concurrent scale 
- Network operators

#### 2. Add IP addresses and ports to your whitelist

Add the following test IP addresses and ports to your whitelist.

> The sources are the clients that integrate the Agora Web SDK.

#### 3. Use the cloud proxy on the client

Before joining a channel, call the `startProxyServer` method to use the cloud proxy service and set `type` as `3`, and then test if the audio call and video call or the live streaming works. 

<div class="alert info">Ensure that you refer to the appropriate Quickstart Guide to enable basic audio and video or live streaming functions.</div> 

```javascript
var client = AgoraRTC.createClient({mode: 'live',codec: 'vp8'});

// Start using the cloud proxy.
client.startProxyServer();
// Join a channel.
client.init(key, function() {
    client.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
        .......
    })
})
```

#### 4. Stop using the cloud proxy on the client

To stop using the cloud proxy, call the `stopProxyServer` method after leaving the channel.

```javascript
// After using the cloud proxy and joining the channel.
...
// Leave the channel and stop using the cloud proxy.
client.leave(()=>{
	client.stopProxyServer()
})

// Join the channel.
client.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
...
}
```

## API reference

- [startProxyServer](./API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.client.html#startproxyserver)
- [stopProxyServer](./API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.client.html#stopproxyserver)

## Considerations

- The `startProxyServer` and  `stopProxyServer` methods must be called before joining the channel or after leaving the channel.
- The Agora Web SDK also provides the `setProxyServer` and `setTurnServer` methods for you to deploy the proxy. The `setProxyServer` and `setTurnServer` methods cannot be used with the `startProxyServer` method at the same time, else an error occurs.
- The `stopProxyServer` method disables all proxy settings, including those set by the `setProxyServer` and `setTurnServer` methods.
