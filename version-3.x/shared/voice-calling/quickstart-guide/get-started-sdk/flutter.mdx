## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Voice Call functionality.

![1627550978702](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1627550978702)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Voice Call in your project is as follows:

1. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

2. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

3. Publish and subscribe to audio in the channel
After joining a channel, the app client automatically publishes and subscribes to audio and video in the channel. 

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the voice call. 

## <a name="configure"></a>Configure the Agora project

### 1. Get an App ID

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the copy icon in the App ID column.


### 2. Generate a temporary token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](../reference/glossary#token) to authenticate users joining a channel.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTC temporary tokens. To generate an RTC temporary token:
1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, find your project and click **Config**.

2. Click **Generate temp <Vg k="VSDK" /> token** under **Primary Certificate**.
  ![1641971893263](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971893263)
3. Enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click **Generate**. When joining the channel later, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you enter here.

4. Click the copy icon to copy the temporary token.

<div class="alert note">Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only, and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. For details, see <a href="../basic-features/token-server">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</a>.</div>


## Create a Flutter Project

This article uses Visual Studio Code to create a Flutter project. Before you begin, you need to install the Flutter plugin in Visual Studio Code. See [Set up an editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode).

1. Launch Visual Studio Code. Select the **Flutter: New Project** command in **View > Command**. Enter the project name and press `<Enter>`.
2. Select the location of the project in the pop-up window. Visual Studio Code automatically generates a simple project.

## Add dependencies

Add the following dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:

1. Add the `agora_rtc_engine` dependency to integrate Agora Flutter SDK. See https://pub.dev/packages/agora_rtc_engine for the latest version of `agora_rtc_engine`.
2. Add the `permission_handler` dependency to add the permission handling function.

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter


  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.3
	 # Please use the latest version of agora_rtc_engine
  agora_rtc_engine: ^5.2.0
  permission_handler: ^8.3.0
```

Because JCenter is about to retire, Agora publishes the <Vg k="VIDEO" /> Android SDK package to JitPack instead of JCenter. Therefore, to build an Android application, add the following line in the `/android/build.gradle` file of your project:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```


## Implement voice call

Open `main.dart`, remove all code after `void main() => runApp(MyApp());`.

<div class="alert note">If your first line is not <code>void main() => runApp(MyApp());</code>, replace it with <code>void main() => runApp(MyApp());</code> and remove all code after it.</div>

Refer to the following steps to add code to the file:

### 1: Import packages

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:agora_rtc_engine/rtc_engine.dart';
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';
```


### 2: Define App ID and Token

See [Authenticate Your Users with Tokens](../basic-features/token-server).


```dart
/// Define App ID and Token
const APP_ID = '<Your App ID>';
const Token = '<Your Token>';
```

### 3: Define MyApp Class


```dart
// App class
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}
```

### 4: Define app states

```dart
// App state class
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  bool _joined = false;
  int _remoteUid = 0;
  bool _switch = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initPlatformState();
  }

  // Init the app
  Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
    // Get microphone permission
    if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android) {
           await [Permission.microphone].request();
    }

    // Create <Vg k="VSDK" /> client instance
    RtcEngineContext context = RtcEngineContext(APP_ID);
    var engine = await RtcEngine.createWithContext(context);
    // Define event handling logic
    engine.setEventHandler(RtcEngineEventHandler(
        joinChannelSuccess: (String channel, int uid, int elapsed) {
          print('joinChannelSuccess ${channel} ${uid}');
          setState(() {
            _joined = true;
          });
        }, userJoined: (int uid, int elapsed) {
      print('userJoined ${uid}');
      setState(() {
        _remoteUid = uid;
      });
    }, userOffline: (int uid, UserOfflineReason reason) {
      print('userOffline ${uid}');
      setState(() {
        _remoteUid = 0;
      });
    }));
    // Join channel with channel name as 123
    await engine.joinChannel(Token, '123', null, 0);
  }

  // Build chat UI
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
            return MaterialApp(
                title: 'Agora Audio quickstart',
                home: Scaffold(
                    appBar: AppBar(
                        title: Text('Agora Audio quickstart'),
                    ),
                    body: Center(
                        child: Text('Please chat!'),
                    ),
                ),
            );
        }

}
```


## Run the project

1. Run the following command in the root folder to install dependencies.

	```dart
	flutter packages get
	```

2. Select the device to run the project on from the status bar of Visual Studio Code and run the project.

	```dart
	flutter run
	```
