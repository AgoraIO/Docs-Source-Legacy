Use this guide to quickly start a basic one-to-one voice call with the Agora SDK for Unity.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow of a voice call implemented by the Agora SDK.

![1627550978702](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1627550978702)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Video Call in your project is as follows:

1. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

2. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

3. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, the app client automatically publishes and subscribes to audio in the channel.


For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the voice call.

## Sample project

We provide an open-source [Hello-Unity3D-Agora](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Unity-Quickstart/tree/3.x/API-Example-Unity) sample project on GitHub that implements the basic one-to-one voice call. You can also see how to run the sample project in [Add voice chat to your Unity app on Android and iOS](https://medium.com/agora-io/add-voice-chat-to-your-unity-game-2194dbcf6eff).

## Implement a basic voice call

This section provides instructions on using the Agora Voice SDK for Unity to implement a basic one-to-one voice call, as well as an API call sequence diagram.

![1576216531722](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1576216531722)

### 1. Create the UI

Create the user interface (UI) for a voice call in your project. If you already have one UI in your project, skip to [Get the device permission (Android only)](#permission) or [Initialize IRtcEngine](#initialize).

We recommend adding the following elements to the UI:
- An enter button
- An exit button

### 2. Get the device permission (Android only)

If you build for Android, you should add in APIs to check and request the device permission. For all other platforms, this is handled by the engine, and you can skip to [Initialize IRtcEngine](#initialize).

Unity versions later than **UNITY_2018_3_OR_NEWER** do not automatically request camera and microphone permissions from your Android device. If you are using one of these versions, call the `CheckPermission` method to request access to the camera and microphone of your Android device.

```csharp
#if(UNITY_2018_3_OR_NEWER) 
using UnityEngine.Android; 
#endif 
void Start () 
{  
#if(UNITY_2018_3_OR_NEWER) 
permissionList.Add(Permission.Microphone);  
#endif  
} 
private void CheckPermission()
{ 
#if(UNITY_2018_3_OR_NEWER) 
foreach(string permission in permissionList) 
{ 
if (Permission.HasUserAuthorizedPermission(permission)) 
{ 
} 
else 
{  
Permission.RequestUserPermission(permission); 
} 
} 
#endif 
} 
void Update () 
{  
#if(UNITY_2018_3_OR_NEWER) 
// Ask for your Android device's permissions.
CheckPermission(); 
#endif  
}
```

<a name="initialize"></a>
### 3. Initialize IRtcEngine

Initialize the `IRtcEngine` object before calling any other Agora APIs.

Call the `GetEngine` method and pass in the App ID to initialize the IRtcEngine object.

<div class="alert note">If you want to exit the app or release the memory of <tt>IRtcEngine</tt>, call <tt>Destroy</tt> to destroy the <tt>IRtcEngine</tt> object. See details in <a href="#destroy">Destroy the IRtcEngine object</a >.</div>

Listen for callback events, such as when the local user joins the channel, and when the first audio frame of a remote user is decoded.

```csharp
// Pass an App ID to create and initialize an IRtcEngine object.
mRtcEngine = IRtcEngine.GetEngine (appId); 
// Listen for the OnJoinChannelSuccessHandler callback.
// This callback occurs when the local user successfully joins the channel.
mRtcEngine.OnJoinChannelSuccessHandler = OnJoinChannelSuccessHandler; 
// Listen for the OnUserJoinedHandler callback.
// This callback occurs when the first audio frame of a remote user is received and decoded after the remote user successfully joins the channel.
mRtcEngine.OnUserJoinedHandler = OnUserJoinedHandler; 
// Listen for the OnUserOfflineHandler callback.
// This callback occurs when the remote user leaves the channel or drops offline.
mRtcEngine.OnUserOfflineHandler = OnUserOfflineHandler;
```


### 4. Join a channel

After initializing the `IRtcEngine` object, you can call `JoinChannelByKey` to join a channel. Set the following parameters when calling this method:

- `channelKey`: The token for identifying the role and privileges of a user. Set it as one of the following values:
  - A temporary token generated in Agora Console. A temporary token is valid for 24 hours. For details, see [Get a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token).
  - A token generated at the server. This applies to scenarios with high-security requirements. For details, see [Generate a token from Your Server](../basic-features/token-server).

  <div class="alert note"><ul><li>If your project has enabled the app certificate, ensure that you provide a token.</li><li>Ensure that you do not set <code>channelKey</code> as "".</li></ul></div>

- `channelName`: The unique name of the channel to join. Users that input the same channel name join the same channel.

- `uid`: Integer. The unique ID of the local user. If you set `uid` as 0, the SDK automatically assigns one user ID and returns it in the `OnJoinChannelSuccessHandler` callback.

 <div class="alert note">Once the user joins the channel, the user subscribes to the audio and video streams of all the other users in the channel by default, giving rise to usage and billing calculation. If you do not want to subscribe to a specified stream or all remote streams, call the <tt>Mute</tt> methods accordingly.</div>

```csharp
// Join a channel.
mRtcEngine.JoinChannelByKey(null, channel, null, 0);
```

### 5. Leave the channel

According to your scenario, such as when the call ends and when you need to close the app, call `LeaveChannel` to leave the current call.

```csharp
public void leave()
    {
        Debug.Log ("calling leave");
        if (mRtcEngine == null)
            return;
        // Leave the channel.
        mRtcEngine.LeaveChannel();
    }
```

<a name="destroy"></a>
###  6. Destroy the IRtcEngine object

After leaving the channel, if you want to exit the app or release the memory of `IRtcEngine`, call `Destroy` to destroy the `IRtcEngine` object.

```csharp
void OnApplicationQuit()
{
    if (mRtcEngine != null)
    {
    // Destroy the IRtcEngine object.
    IRtcEngine.Destroy();
    mRtcEngine = null;
    }
}
```


## Run the project

Run the project in Unity. You should be able to see both the local and remote video if you successfully start a one-to-one voice call.
