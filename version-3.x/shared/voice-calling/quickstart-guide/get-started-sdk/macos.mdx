Use this guide to quickly start a basic voice call demo with the Agora Voice SDK for macOS.

## Understand the tech

![1623991425414](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1623991425414)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Voice Call in your project is as follows:

1. Retrieve a token
   A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

2. Join a channel
   Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

3. Publish and subscribe to audio in the channel
   After joining a channel, the app client automatically publishes and subscribes to audio in the channel.

For an app client to join an <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel, you need the following information:

- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the voice call.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 11.0 or later (the interface description in this article is based on Xcode 11.0).
- A macOS device running macOS 10.10 or later.
- A valid [Agora account](../reference/manage-agora-account#sign-up-and-log-in).

<div class="alert info">
  If you need to integrate SDK with versions earlier than v3.2.0, see
  integration steps in{' '}
  <a href="#earlierversion">Integrate earlier versions of the SDK</a>.
</div>

### Method 1: Through CocoaPods

1. Ensure that you have installed CocoaPods before the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project.

   ```shell
   # platform :macos, '10.11'
   target 'Your App' do
     pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_macOS'
   end
   ```

4. Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

### Method 2: Through the Agora website

1. Navigate to [SDK Downloads](https://docs.agora.io/en/sdks), download the latest version of the Agora macOS SDK, and extract the files from the downloaded SDK package.

2. According to your requirements, copy the libraries from the `libs` folder of the SDK to the `./project_name` folder in your project (`project_name` is an example of your project name).

3. Open Xcode, and navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

4. Click **+** > **Add Otherâ€¦** > **Add Files** to add the corresponding libraries. Ensure that the **Embed** attribute of these dynamic libraries is **Embed & Sign**.

<div class="alert note">
  <ul>
    <li>
      According to the official requirements of Apple, the Extension of an app
      cannot contain the dynamic library. If you need to integrate the SDK with
      the dynamic library in the Extension, change the file status to{' '}
      <b>Do Not Embed</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Agora SDK uses libc++ (LLVM) by default. Contact support@agora.io if
      you want to use libstdc++ (GNU). The SDK provides FAT image libraries with
      multi-architecture support for both 32/64-bit audio emulators and
      32/64-bit audio/video real devices.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Method 3: Through Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode, go to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependencies...**, and paste the following URL:

   ```shellscript
   https://github.com/AgoraIO/AgoraAudio_macOS
   ```

2. In **Choose Package Options**, specify the SDK version that you want to integrate. If the version number is x.y.z, fill in **x.y.z**; if the version number is x.y.z.a, fill in **x.y.z-r.a**.

<div class="alert note">
  <ul>
    <li>For the macOS SDK, Agora provides Swift Packages as of v3.6.2.</li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>Use the Swift Package Manager on a network with access to GitHub.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Implementation

Once you have integrated the Agora macOS SDK into your project, you need to call the core APIs provided by the Agora macOS SDK in the `ViewController` file to implement basic voice call. The API call sequence is shown in the following figure:

![1626337756069](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1626337756069)

<a name="ImportClass"></a>

### 1. Import the class

Before calling any Agora API, import the `AgoraRtcKit` class, and define `agoraKit`.

#### Objective-C

```objc
// ViewController.h
// Imports the AgoraRtcKit class
// For SDKs earlier than 3.0.0, AgoraRtcKit is named AgoraRtcEngineKit
// If you use a SDK earlier than 3.0.0, use "#import &ltAgoraRtcEngineKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h&gt" instead
#import &ltAgoraRtcKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h&gt
// Specifies AgoraRtcEngineDelegate for monitoring a callback
@interface ViewController : NSViewController &ltAgoraRtcEngineDelegate&gt
// Defines agoraKit
@property (strong, nonatomic) AgoraRtcEngineKit *agoraKit;
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Imports the AgoraRtcKit class
// For SDKs earlier than 3.0.0, AgoraRtcKit is named AgoraRtcEngineKit
// If you use a SDK earlier than 3.0.0, use "import AgoraRtcEngineKit" instead
import AgoraRtcKit
class ViewController: NSViewController {
    ...
    // Defines agoraKit
    var agoraKit: AgoraRtcEngineKit?
}
```

### 2. Initialize AgoraRtcEngineKit

Call the `sharedEngineWithAppId` method to create and initialize the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object.

When adding the following code in your project, replace `YourAppID` with the App ID of your project. See [Get an App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id).

If you want to monitor a callback for your app scenario, register it when initializing `AgoraRtcEngineKit`.

#### Objective-C

```objc
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
self.agoraKit = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:@"YourAppID" delegate:self];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
agoraKit = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(withAppId: "YourAppID", delegate: self)
```

<a name="JoinChannel"></a>

### 3. Join a channel

Call the `joinChannelByToken` method to join a channel. When adding the following code in your project, replace `YourToken` with the token of your project, and replace `YourChannelName` with the channel name used to generate the token of your project.

- For testing, you can [generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in Agora Console.
- For production, Agora recommends using a token generated at your server. See [Generate a Token](../basic-features/token-server).

<div class="alert note">
  By default, a user who has joined a channel subscribes to the audio streams of
  all the other users in the channel. This will generate usage and affect
  billing. If you do not want to subscribe to a specific stream or all remote
  streams, call the <tt>mute</tt> methods accordingly.
</div>

#### Objective-C

```objc
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// The uid of each user in the channel must be unique.
[self.agoraKit joinChannelByToken:@"YourToken" channelId:@"YourChannelName" info:nil uid:0 joinSuccess:^(NSString * _Nonnull channel, NSUInteger uid, NSInteger elapsed) {
}];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines, such as viewDidLoad()
// The uid of each user in the channel must be unique.
agoraKit?.joinChannel(byToken: "YourToken", channelId: "YourChannelName", info: nil, uid: 0, joinSuccess: { (channel, uid, elapsed) in
})
```

### 4. Leave the channel

Call the `leaveChannel` method when you need to leave the channel, for example, to end the call, close the app, or run the app in the background.

#### Objective-C

```objc
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
[self.agoraKit leaveChannel:nil];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
agoraKit?.leaveChannel(nil)
```

### 5. Destroy AgoraRtcEngineKit

After leaving the channel, if you want to release all resources used by the Agora SDK, call the `destroy` method to destroy the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object.

#### Objective-C

```objc
// ViewController.m
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
[AgoraRtcEngineKit destroy];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// ViewController.swift
// Types the followiing code in the function you defines
AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()
```

## Run the project

Before running the project, you need to set your signing and team, and add device permissions.

### 1. Set your signing and team

1. In Xcode, navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Signing**, and choose **Automatically manage signing**.
2. Read the prompts carefully, and click **Enable Automatic**.
3. After you successfully set your signing, choose a developer in **Team**.

### 2. Add device permissions

1. In Xcode, open the `info.plist` file. Add the following contents to add permissions for your device:

| Key                                    | Type   | Value                                                                                       |
| :------------------------------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Privacy - Microphone Usage Description | String | The purpose for accessing the microphone, such as for a call or interactive live streaming. |

2. Navigate to **TARGETS** > **Project Name** > **Signing & Capabilities**, and add the following permissions in **App Sandbox** and **Hardened Runtime**:

| Capability       | Category        | Permission                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| App Sandbox      | Network         | <ul><li>Incoming Connections (Server)</li><li>Outgoing Connections (Client)</li></ul> |
| App Sandbox      | Hardware        | Audio Input                                                                           |
| Hardened Runtime | Resource Access | Audio Input                                                                           |

{' '}
<div class="alert note">
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you need to add a third-party plug-in or library, and the signing of
      the third-party plug-in or library is different from your project, you
      need to navigate to <b>Hardened Runtime</b> > <b>Runtime Exceptions</b>,
      and check the <b>Disable Library Validation</b> option.

      </a>
      .
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

3. In Xcode 12.2 and later, to avoid compliation errors, you need to navigate to **TARGETS** > **Project Name** > **Build Settings** > **Architectures**, and set the **Architectures** property to **x86_64** before the compilation.

### 3. Try a voice call

Agora recommends running the project on a real device instead of a simulator.

To test the remote audio, visit the [Web Demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/), and enter the same App ID, channel name, and token to join the same channel. You should hear the remote user when you successfully start a one-to-one voice call in the app.

## Integrate earlier versions of the SDK

Choose one of the following methods to integrate a version of the Agora macOS SDK earlier than v3.2.0.

### Method 1: Through CocoaPods

1. Ensure that you have installed CocoaPods before performing the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project and replace `version` with the version of the SDK that you want to integrate. For information about the SDK version, see [Release Notes](../introduction/release-notes).

```
# platform :macos, '10.11'
target 'Your App' do
 pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_macOS', 'version'
end
```

4. Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

### Method 2: Through your local storage

You need to use different integration methods to integrate different versions of the SDK. Click the following version categories to expand the corresponding integration steps.

<details>
	<summary><font color="#3ab7f8">From v3.2.0 to v3.2.1</font></summary>
