## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Voice Call functionality.

![1627550978702](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1627550978702)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Voice Call in your project is as follows:

1. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

2. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

3. Publish and subscribe to audio in the channel
After joining a channel, the app client automatically publishes and subscribes to audio and video in the channel. 

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the voice call. 

## Prerequisites

## Create a Cocos Creator project

Use the following steps to build a project from scratch:

1. Open Cocos Creator, and navigate to **New Project**.
2. Choose an example (**Hello World** shown here), choose a storage path, and enter a project name.
3. Click **Create**.

## Integrate the SDK

1. Open a Cocos Creator project, and click **Service** on the right to open the **Service** panel.
2. Click the ![1603983326448](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1603983326448) button following **AppID**, and click **Set Cocos AppID**.
  ![1603983352672](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1603983352672)
3. Click the drop-down box, select a game, and click **Association** to associate your project with your game.
4. On the **Service** panel, scroll down to find and click **Agora RTC**.
5. Click the ![1603983397604](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1603983397604) button following **Agora RTC**, read the prompts carefully, and click **Open Service**.
6. On the bottom of the **Agora RTC** panel, select **Audio** as the SDK type, and click **Save** to integrate the Agora Cocos Creator SDK.


After integrating the Agora Cocos Creator SDK, Cocos Creator automatically adds codes in your project for obtaining device permissions, so you do not need to write these codes yourself.

Cocos Creator also uses your Cocos Creator account to automatically register an Agora account and create an Agora project. You can click **Dashboard** on the **Agora RTC** panel to visit Agora Console.

## <a name="configure"></a>Configure the Agora project

### 1. Get an App ID

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the copy icon in the App ID column.


### 2. Generate a temporary token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](../reference/glossary#token) to authenticate users joining a channel.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTC temporary tokens. To generate an RTC temporary token:
1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, find your project and click **Config**.
  ![1641971834422](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971834422)
2. Click **Generate temp RTC token** under **Primary Certificate**.
  ![1641971893263](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971893263)
3. Enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click **Generate**. When joining the channel later, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you enter here.
 <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649997524064" />
4. Click the copy icon to copy the temporary token.
 <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649997750496" />

<div class="alert note">Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only, and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. For details, see <a href="../basic-features/token-server">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</a>.</div>

## Implementation

Once the project is set up, create a component script and a scene based on your requirements, and add the script into the scene node. See [Creating and using component script](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/scripting/use-component.html).

You can use core APIs of the Agora Cocos Creator SDK in a component script to implement a basic voice call. The following figure shows the API call sequence:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1603983906888)

### 1. Create a user interface

Create a user interface (UI) for the interactive live audio streaming in your project. If you already have a UI in your project, skip to [Initialize the Agora engine](#initialize).

Agora recommends adding the following elements to the UI:

- A voice call window
- An end-call button

### <a name="initialize"></a>2. Initialize the Agora engine

Initialize the Agora engine before calling any other Agora APIs. You need to pass in the App ID of your Agora project in this step. See [Get the Agora App ID](#configure).

Call `init` and pass in the App ID to initialize the Agora engine.

According to your requirements, you can also listen for callback events in this step, such as when the local user joins or leaves the channel.

```typescript
// Initialize the Agora engine. You need to use your Agora App ID to replace YOUR_APPID.
agora.init("YOUR_APPID");
// Listen for callback events.
initAgoraEvents: function () {
    if (agora) {
        agora.on('joinChannelSuccess', this.onJoinChannelSuccess, this);
        agora.on('leaveChannel', this.onLeaveChannel, this);
        agora.on('warning', this.onWarning, this);
        agora.on('error', this.onError, this);
        agora.on('userJoined', this.onUserJoined, this);
        agora.on('userOffline', this.onUserOffline, this);
    }
}
```

### <a name="join"></a>3. Join a channel

After initializing the Agora engine, you can call `joinChannel` to join a channel. You need to generate a token to replace `YOUR_TOKEN` in the code sample below.

- For testing, you can [generate a temporary token](#configure) in Agora Console.
- For production, Agora recommends using a token generated at your server. See [Generate a Token](../basic-features/token_server).

<div class="alert note">Once the user joins the channel, the user subscribes to the audio streams of all the other users in the channel by default, giving rise to usage and billing calculation. If you do not want to subscribe to a specified stream or all remote streams, call the <tt>mute</tt> methods accordingly.</div>

```typescript
// For SDKs earlier than v3.1.2, call this method to enable interoperability between the Agora Cocos Creator SDK and the Agora Web SDK if the Agora Web SDK is in the channel.
// As of v3.1.2, the Agora Cocos Creator SDK enables the interoperability with the Agora Web SDK by default, so you do not need to call this method.
agora.enableWebSdkInteroperability(true);
// Join a channel with a token.
agora.joinChannel("YOUR_TOKEN", “channel5”, "Extra Optional Data", 0);
```

### 4. Leave the channel

According to your scenario, such as when the voice call ends and when you need to close the app, call `leaveChannel` to leave the current channel.

```typescript
agora.leaveChannel();
```

### 5. Destroy the Agora engine

After leaving the channel, if you want to exit the app or release the memory of the Agora engine, call `release` to destroy the Agora engine.

```typescript
agora.release();
```

## Run the project

Agora recommends running and debugging your project through a real Android or iOS device. See [Compile and preview](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/publish/publish-native.html#compile-and-preview).

When the voice call starts successfully, you can hear remote users in the app.

## Q&A

Q: I set a correct build path. Why do I receive the `xxx.o:No such file or directory` error message?
A: The cause of this problem is that the bulild path is too long. You need to shorten the bulild path. For example, change the bulild path to the disk root.

## Reference

Agora provide an open-source [sample project](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Agora-Cocos-Quickstart/tree/master/CocosCreator) on GitHub that implements a basic one-to-one voice call. You can download the demo project as a code source reference.
