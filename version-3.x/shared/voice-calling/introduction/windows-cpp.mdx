This page provides the release notes for the Agora Voice SDK for Windows.

## v3.7.1

v3.7.1 was released on August 4, 2022.

#### Improvements

**1. Co-hosting across channels**

This release enhances the connection mechanism between the SDK and the server of co-hosting across channels and therefore reduces the failure rate.


#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, the app got stuck after a user joined a channel.
- The local user received the `onRemoteAudioStateChanged(2,6)` callback after disconnecting from and reconnecting to a network even though the remote user had not changed the audio state.
- `gatewayRtt` reported by the `onRtcStats` callback was inaccurate when the network latency was too high or the router did not respond to ICMP packets.
- Occasionally, it took users longer than normal to join a channel for the first time.

## v3.7.0.2

v3.7.0.2 was released on June 6, 2022 and improved the stability of the SDK.

## v3.7.0

v3.7.0 was released on April 11, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the feature of spatial audio effect, which can add a sense of space to remote users' audio and simulate the audio transmission process in the real world. This enables the local user to hear remote users with the spatial audio effect.

To use this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**2. Local voice pitch**

This release adds the `enableLocalVoicePitchCallback` method and the `onLocalVoicePitchInHz` callback, to allow the SDK to report the voice pitch of the local user at the set time interval to the app.

**3. Reporting the user role switch failure**

This release adds the `onClientRoleChangeFailed` callback to report the reason for a user role switch failure and the current user role in the interactive live streaming.

**4. Reasons for connection state changes**

To help users better understand the cause of connection state changes, this release adds the following enumerators in `CONNECTION_CHANGED_REASON_TYPE`:

- `CONNECTION_CHANGED_SAME_UID_LOGIN(19)`: Join the same channel from different devices using the same user ID.
- `CONNECTION_CHANGED_TOO_MANY_BROADCASTERS(20)`: The number of hosts in the channel reaches the upper limit. This enumerator is reported only after the support for 128 hosts is enabled.

#### Improvements

**1. Channel capacity improvement**

As of this release, a single channel can support up to 128 concurrent online hosts, who can publish audio streams at the same time. The number of audience members in a channel is unlimited. Each host or audience member can subscribe to a maximum of 50 hosts at the same time.

To experience this improvement, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**2. A new version of deep-learning noise reduction**

Agora has added the option of using a new version of deep-learning noise reduction to further improve audio quality. To experience this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io)

**3. playEffect improvements**

This release improves the internal implementation logic of `playEffect` to avoid blocking and reduce freezing when playing an audio effect file.

**4. Audio experience optimization**

This release reduces audio stuttering under network conditions with burst jitter and high packet loss.

**5. Transmission upgrade**

This release upgrades transmission protocols and algorithms to enhance the SDK's ability to counter poor network conditions. 

#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableLocalVoicePitchCallback`
- `onLocalVoicePitchInHz`
- `onClientRoleChangeFailed`
- `CONNECTION_CHANGED_SAME_UID_LOGIN(19)` and `CONNECTION_CHANGED_TOO_MANY_BROADCASTERS(20)` in `CONNECTION_CHANGED_REASON_TYPE`

**Deprecated**

- Error code `ERR_SET_CLIENT_ROLE_NOT_AUTHORIZED(119)`. Use `CLIENT_ROLE_CHANGE_FAILED_REASON` instead.


## v3.6.2

v3.6.2 was released on February 22, 2022.

#### Improvements

**1. Cloud proxy**

To enrich application scenarios of the Agora Cloud Proxy, this release updates the cloud proxy types (`CLOUD_PROXY_TYPE`) as follows:

- Changes the meaning of `NONE_PROXY(0)` from "Do not use the cloud proxy" to "Automatic mode". In this mode, the SDK attempts a direct connection to SD-RTN™ and automatically switches to TLS 443 if the attempt fails. As of v3.6.2, the SDK has this mode enabled by default.
- Adds `TCP_PROXY(2)`, which is the TCP (encrypted) mode. In this mode, the SDK always transmits data over TLS 443.

In addition, this release adds the `onProxyConnected` callback to report the proxy connection state. For example, when a user calls `setCloudProxy` and joins a channel successfully, the SDK triggers this callback to report the user ID, the proxy type connected, and the time elapsed from the user calling `joinChannel` until this callback is triggered.

**2. Audio device test**

To support testing audio devices after joining a channel, this release improves the following methods and callbacks:

- Adds `onAudioDeviceTestVolumeIndication`, which reports the volume information of the audio device being tested.
- Changes call sequence of `startRecordingDeviceTest`, `startPlaybackDeviceTest`, and `startAudioDeviceLoopbackTest`. Before v3.6.2, you can call these methods only before joining a channel; as of v3.6.2, you can call these methods either before or after joining a channel. After a successful method call, the SDK triggers the following callbacks:
  - `onAudioVolumeIndication` and `onAudioDeviceTestVolumeIndication` when you call the methods before joining a channel. Both callbacks report the same volume information. If you upgrade the SDK to v3.6.2 or later, Agora recommendeds using `onAudioDeviceTestVolumeIndication`.
  - `onAudioDeviceTestVolumeIndication` when you call the methods after joining a channel.

<div class="alert note">Calling <code>startRecordingDeviceTest</code>, <code>startPlaybackDeviceTest</code>, or <code>startAudioDeviceLoopbackTest</code> after joining a channel tests the audio devices that the SDK is using.</div>

**3. Audio recording**

This release extends `startAudioRecording` with support for setting recording with dual channels and higher audio quality.

- By adding `recordingChannel` to `AudioRecordingConfiguration`, it enables you to set the recorded audio channel to be mono or dual. Because the actual recorded audio channel is related to the captured audio channel and the integration scheme affects the final recorded audio channel, contact technical support for assistance with stereo recording using `startAudioRecording`.
- By adding `AUDIO_RECORDING_QUALITY_ULTRA_HIGH(3)` to `AudioRecordingConfiguration.recordingQuality`, it enables you to set the recorded audio quality to ultra-high. Ultra-high quality is the highest quality available in `recordingQuality`. When you record a 10-minute AAC audio file at a sample rate of 32,000 Hz and ultra-high quality, the file size is approximately 7.5 MB.

**4. Music file playback**

This release optimizes the experience of calling `startAudioMixing` to play music files as follows:

- Reduces issues of audio freezes or no audio when playing music files.
- Increases the accuracy of the audio duration reported by `getAudioFileInfo`.
- Supports more audio file formats. See [Which audio file formats does the Agora RTC SDK support](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/faq/audio_format).

If you want to experience these improvements, ensure that you have integrated the `libagora-full-audio-format-extension.dll` dynamic library. Given the large size of this library, if you have limitations on app size and do not need these improvements, you can remove this dynamic library when integrating the SDK. For more instructions, see <Link to="/3.x/shared/common/reduce-app-size?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Reduce App Size</Link>.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the issue that remote users could hear the local user with echoes when the local user was in a specific reverb environment.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `onAudioDeviceTestVolumeIndication` 
- `recordingChannel` in `AudioRecordingConfiguration`
- `AUDIO_RECORDING_QUALITY_ULTRA_HIGH(3)` in `AudioRecordingConfiguration.recordingQuality`
- `onProxyConnected`
- `TCP_PROXY(2)` in `CLOUD_PROXY_TYPE`

**Modified**

- Timing restrictions for the `startRecordingDeviceTest`, `startPlaybackDeviceTest`, and `startAudioDeviceLoopbackTest` method calls. 
- The behavior of `NONE_PROXY(0)` in `CLOUD_PROXY_TYPE`.

## v3.6.1.1

v3.6.1.1 was released on January 16, 2022. 

This release fixed the following audio issue:

When an end user muted and unmuted audio from an application using the Agora Web SDK, end users using an application with Native SDK version 3.6.0 might not hear audio from this end user.

## v3.6.1

v3.6.1 was released on January 14, 2022.

This release fixed the following issues:

- The CDN live streaming failed because of the abnormal resolution of the RTMP streaming URL with a port number.
- Crashes occurred on some devices running on Windows 7.

## v3.6.0

v3.6.0 was released on December 7, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Media Push**

To reduce the difficulty of integrating Media Push, this release optimizes the API design of Media Push and improves the handling of network issues within Media Push clients and servers. You can experience the optimized Media Push functionality with the following new methods:

- `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscoding`: Starts pushing media streams to a CDN without transcoding. This method works the same as the old method `addPublishStreamUrl(false)`.
- `startRtmpStreamWithTranscoding`: Starts pushing media streams to a CDN and sets the transcoding configuration. This method works the same as calling the old methods `setLiveTranscoding` and `addPublishStreamUrl(true)` in sequence.
- `updateRtmpTranscoding`: Updates the transcoding configuration. This method works the same as the non-first call to the old method `setLiveTranscoding`.
- `stopRtmpStream`: Stops pushing media streams to a CDN. This method works the same as the old method `removePublishStreamUrl`.

<div class="alert note">
This release deprecates three old methods for Media Push: <code>addPublishStreamUrl</code>, <code>setLiveTranscoding</code>, and <code>removePublishStreamUrl</code>. Agora recommends that you use the new methods for Media Push and update your code logic by referring to <Link to="/3.x/shared/interactive-live-streaming/media-push?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Media Push</Link>.</div>


Also, as of this release, whether you use the new or old methods for Media Push, you can experience the following improvements:

- Reporting streaming states, errors, and events:

    - In the `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_STATE` state code, adding `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_STATE_DISCONNECTING(5)`: The SDK is disconnecting from the Agora streaming server and CDN. When you call `remove` or `stop` to stop the streaming normally, the SDK reports the streaming state as `DISCONNECTING`, `IDLE` in sequence.
    - Renaming `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR` to `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_TYPE` and adding the following to the `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_TYPE` error code:
        - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_NOT_BROADCASTER(11)`: The user role is not host, so the user cannot use the Media Push function. Check your application code logic.
        - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_TRANSCODING_NO_MIX_STREAM(13)`: The `update` or `setLiveTranscoding` method is called to update the transcoding configuration in a scenario where there is streaming without transcoding. Check your application code logic.
        - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_NET_DOWN(14)`: Errors occurred in the host's network.
        - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_INVALID_APPID(15)`: Your App ID does not have permission to use the Media Push function. Refer to <Link to="/3.x/shared/interactive-live-streaming/media-push#prerequisites?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Prerequisites</Link> to enable the Media Push permission.
    - Adding the following to the `RTMP_STREAMING_EVENT` event code:
        - `RTMP_STREAMING_EVENT_ADVANCED_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORT(3)`: The feature is not supported.
        - `RTMP_STREAMING_EVENT_REQUEST_TOO_OFTEN(4)`: Reserved.

    <div class="alert note">To ensure the quality of the Media Push, make sure to handle the business logic according to the state code, error code, and event code.</div>

- Using the HE-AAC v2 audio codec during streaming with transcoding: This is achieved by adding `AUDIO_CODEC_PROFILE_HE_AAC_V2(2)` to `AUDIO_CODEC_PROFILE_TYPE`.


**2. Following the system default audio device**

To help developers more flexibly manage audio device switching, this release adds the following methods in the `IAudioDeviceCollection` class:

- `getDefaultDevice`: Gets the default audio device of the system.
- `followSystemPlaybackDevice`: Sets the audio playback device used by the SDK to follow the system default audio playback device.
- `followSystemRecordingDevice`: Sets the audio recording device used by the SDK to follow the system default audio recording device.

On Windows, after initialized, the SDK uses the system default audio device to play and capture audio by default. This release optimizes the default processing logic of the SDK when the system default audio device changes, as follows:

- With versions earlier than v3.6.0, the SDK follows the system default audio device only when the following occurs:

  - A user connects a new audio device, and the system default audio device changes to the newly connected audio device.

  - A user disconnects or disables an audio device, and that audio device is being used by the SDK.

- With v3.6.0 and later versions, the SDK always follows the system default audio device. If you do not need the SDK to follow the system default audio device, call `followSystemPlaybackDevice(false)` and `followSystemRecordingDevice(false)`.



#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the issue: When the local user called `enableLoopbackRecording` to enable loopback audio capturing on some devices, remote users heard the audio being played back twice.


#### API changes

**Added**

- `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscoding`
- `startRtmpStreamWithTranscoding`
- `updateRtmpTranscoding`
- `stopRtmpStream`
- `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_STATE_DISCONNECTING(5)` in `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_STATE`
- The following enumerators in `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_TYPE`:
  - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_NOT_BROADCASTER(11)`
  - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_TRANSCODING_NO_MIX_STREAM(13)`
  - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_NET_DOWN(14)`
  - `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_INVALID_APPID(15)`
- The following enumerators in `RTMP_STREAMING_EVENT`:
  - `RTMP_STREAMING_EVENT_ADVANCED_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORT(3)`
  - `RTMP_STREAMING_EVENT_REQUEST_TOO_OFTEN(4)`
- `AUDIO_CODEC_PROFILE_HE_AAC_V2(2)` in `AUDIO_CODEC_PROFILE_TYPE`
- The following methods in the `IAudioDeviceCollection` class:
  - `getDefaultDevice`
  - `followSystemPlaybackDevice`
  - `followSystemRecordingDevice`

**Modified**

- Renamed the enumeration `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR` to `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_ERROR_TYPE`


## v3.5.2

v3.5.2 was released on November 25, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**Error codes returned when the request to join a channel is rejected**

To more accurately report the reason for the failure to join a channel, as of this release, the SDK returns the error code `-17 (ERR_JOIN_CHANNEL_REJECTED)` in the return value of the joining channel method in the following situations:

- When a user who has already joined an `IRtcEngine` channel calls the joining channel method of the `IRtcEngine` class with a valid channel name.
- When a user who has already joined an `IChannel` channel calls the joining channel method of this `IChannel` object.

In the SDK earlier than v3.5.2, when the above errors occur, the SDK might report the error code `17` through the `onError` callback, or return the error code `-5 (ERR_REFUSED)` in the return value of the joining channel method.

#### New features

**Testing audio call loop**

To check whether the local audio device and network conditions can guarantee the proper sending and receiving of audio streams, this release adds the `startEchoTest` [3/3] method. You can call this method before joining a channel to test whether the loop of a user's audio device and network conditions are working properly.

Compared to `startEchoTest` [2/3], `startEchoTest` [3/3] can secure the test, but cannot support setting the time interval for reporting test results.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Remote users heard slightly unsynchronized voice and music when a user called `startAudioMixing` on some Android devices.
- The system version of Windows was incorrectly recognized on some devices.

#### API changes

This release adds the [`startEchoTest`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a394c60056c0cd31af48e8015b0c553f4) [3/3] method.

## v3.5.1

v3.5.1 was released on October 14, 2021.

#### New features

**1. Pausing and resuming the media stream relay across channels**

In order to enable the host to quickly pause or resume a cross-channel media stream relay, this release adds the following methods and event code:

- `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay`: Pauses the media stream relay to all destination channels.
- `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`: Resumes the media stream relay to all destination channels.
- `RELAY_EVENT_PAUSE_SEND_PACKET_TO_DEST_CHANNEL_SUCCESS(12)`: The SDK successfully pauses relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `RELAY_EVENT_PAUSE_SEND_PACKET_TO_DEST_CHANNEL_FAILED(13)`: The SDK fails to pause relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `RELAY_EVENT_RESUME_SEND_PACKET_TO_DEST_CHANNEL_SUCCESS(14)`: The SDK successfully resumes relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `RELAY_EVENT_RESUME_SEND_PACKET_TO_DEST_CHANNEL_FAILED(15)`: The SDK fails to resume relaying the media stream to destination channels.

After a successful method call of `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay` or `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`, the SDK triggers the `onChannelMediaRelayEvent` callback to report whether the media stream relay is successfully paused or resumed.

**2. Pushing the external audio frame to a specified position**

To meet the different processing requirements of external audio frames in different scenarios, this release deprecates `pushAudioFrame`[2/3] and adds `pushAudioFrame`[3/3] with `sourcePos` instead. You can push the external audio frame to one of three positions: after audio capture, before audio encoding, or before local playback. For example, in the KTV scenario, you can push the singing voice to after audio capture, and push the accompaniment to before audio encoding, so that the singing voice is processed by the SDK audio module, but the accompaniment is not affected by the SDK audio module.

This release also adds `setExternalAudioSourceVolume`, which enables you to set the volume of external audio frames at a specified position.

**3. Advanced settings of the music file**

To set the playback speed, audio track, and channel mode of a music file, this release adds the following methods:

- `setAudioMixingPlaybackSpeed`: Sets the playback speed of the current music file. Agora recommends a value range of [50,400], where 100 represents the original speed.
- `getAudioTrackCount`: Gets the number of audio tracks of the current music file.
- `selectAudioTrack`: Specifies the playback audio track of the current music file. The range of index is [0, getAudioTrackCount()).
- `setAudioMixingDualMonoMode`: Sets the channel mode of the current music file to original mode, left channel mode, right channel mode, or mixed channel mode.

**4. Getting audio file information**

To get the information of any audio file, this release deprecates `getAudioMixingDuration` and adds `getAudioFileInfo` instead. After joining a channel, you can call `getAudioFileInfo` and get information such as duration for the specified audio file in `onRequestAudioFileInfo`.

#### Improvements

**1. Audio device errors**

This release adds the following error codes in `LOCAL_AUDIO_STREAM_ERROR`:

- `LOCAL_AUDIO_STREAM_ERROR_RECORD_INVALID_ID(9)`, which indicates that the ID of the audio capture device is invalid.
- `LOCAL_AUDIO_STREAM_ERROR_PLAYOUT_INVALID_ID(10)`, which indicates that the ID of the audio playback device is invalid.

**2. Identification and quality testing for 5G mobile networks**

This release adds identification and connection quality testing for 5G mobile networks:

- Adds `NETWORK_TYPE_MOBILE_5G(6)` to `NETWORK_TYPE`. When the local network changes to 5G, the SDK triggers the `onNetworkTypeChanged` callback to report this network connection type.
- Supports calling `enableLastmileTest` or `startLastmileProbeTest` to test the connection quality of the 5G mobile network.

**3. Other improvements**

This release also provides the following improvements:

- Adds continuous optimization of the portrait edge effect of the virtual background.
- In scenarios with high CPU usage, the audio experience is improved when the sound card is used for audio capture.
- Adds support for audio playback devices with S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface).
- After enabling deep-learning noise reduction, the audio experience is improved when using some Bluetooth headsets.

#### Fixed issues

This release has fixed the following issues:

- In the `GAME_STREAMING` scenario, occasional echo or noise that was caused by inaccurate music detection occurred.
- When the local user called `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams` and received `onRemoteAudioStateChanged(REMOTE_AUDIO_REASON_LOCAL_MUTED)`, `onRemoteAudioStateChanged(REMOTE_AUDIO_REASON_REMOTE_MUTED)` was incorrectly received after 15 seconds.
- The SDK repeatedly triggered the `onAudioDeviceStateChanged` callback when the user connected or disconnected an audio device.
- As of v3.4.5, the return value was inaccurate when you called `joinChannel` multiple times in a row.
- The method call of `setExternalAudioSource` before joining the channel did not take effect.
- Echoes could occur when you used a fiber optic speaker.
- The SDK additionally triggered the `onLocalAudioStateChanged` callback to report `LOCAL_AUDIO_STREAM_STATE_CAPTURING(1)` when you called `enableLocalAudio(false)` after joining a channel.

#### API changes

**Deprecated**

- `pushAudioFrame`[2/3]
- `getAudioMixingDuration`

## v3.5.0.4

v3.5.0.4 was released on September 26, 2021.

This release fixed the following issues:

- When you called `startAudioDeviceLoopbackTest` to start the audio device loopback test after joining and then immediately leaving a channel, the content of the `AudioVolumeInfo` array reported by the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback was incorrect.
- When using previously released 3.5.x versions of the SDK, the local user could not be heard by remote users when the local user used custom audio capture by the Push method.

## v3.5.0.3

v3.5.0.3 was released on September 6, 2021 and improved the stability of the SDK.

## v3.5.0.1

v3.5.0.1 was released on August 4, 2021 and improved the stability of the SDK.

## v.3.5.0

v3.5.0 was released on July 20, 2021.

#### Improvements

**1. Audio error code**

To help troubleshoot audio issues, this release adds the `ERR_ADM_WIN_CORE_SERVRE_SHUT_DOWN (1735)` error code, which reports that the Windows Audio service is disabled. You need to either enable the Windows Audio service or restart the device.

**2. Additional improvement**

In scenarios where the AGC is enabled, as of this release, the convergence time for noise reduction is shortened, which reduces noise fluctuations.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- After a remote user called `enableLoopbackRecording`, occasionally the local user heard an echo of their own audio.
- After calling `muteLocalAudioStream(true)` to stop publishing a local audio stream, the local user could hear remote users when the local user joined a channel for the first time. After leaving the channel and joining another channel, occasionally the local user could not hear remote users.
- When the local network quality was poor, the downlink network quality rating (`rxQuality`) of remote users reported by the SDK was not accurate.

#### API changes

This release added the <Link to="/3.x/shared/common/error-codes?platform={{platform.PATH}}">error code</Link>: `ERR_ADM_WIN_CORE_SERVRE_SHUT_DOWN (1735)`.

## v3.4.6

v3.4.6 was released on July 15, 2021 and improved the stability of the SDK.

## v3.4.5

v3.4.5 was released on June 22, 2021.


#### Compatibility changes

**1. Support for GCM2 encryption**

To further improve the security during real-time audio transmission process, this release adds the following:

- `AES_128_GCM2 (7)` and `AES_256_GCM2 (8)` encryption modes in `ENCRYPTION_MODE`. The new GCM encryption modes use a more secure KDF (Key Derivation Function) and support setting the key and salt.
- The `encryptionKdfSalt` member in `EncryptionConfig` to add the salt for the `AES_128_GCM2 (7)` and `AES_256_GCM2 (8)` encryption modes.

This release also changes the default encryption mode from `AES_128_XTS (1)` to `AES_128_GCM2 (7)`. If you use the default encryption mode in earlier versions, after upgrading the SDK to v3.4.5, ensure that you call `enableEncryption` and set `ENCRYPTION_MODE` to `AES_128_XTS (1)`.

See <Link to="/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/channel-encryption?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Media Stream Encryption</Link>.

<div class="alert note">Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users such as the Agora recording service.</div>


**2. Audio stream publishing behavior changes**

To flexibly control the publishing state in multiple channels, this release optimizes the `IChannel` class as follows:

- Deprecates the `publish` and `unpublish` methods, and adds `muteLocalAudioStream` instead. You can set the publishing state of the audio stream.
- Adds the `publishLocalAudio` member in `ChannelMediaOptions`. The default value is `true`. You can set the publishing state when joining a channel. If a user publishes streams in a channel, regardless of whether the user is a host or an audience member, you need to set `publishLocalAudio` to `false` when the user joins other channels; otherwise, the user fails to join the channel.
- After calling `setClientRole(BROADCASTER)`, the local user publishes audio stream by default. You no longer need to call `publish`.


<div class="alert note"><code>publishLocalAudio = false</code> serves the same function as <code>muteLocalAudioStream(true)</code>. If you call them together, the one called later takes effect.</div>

The above improvements bring the following changes in the `IRtcEngine` class:

- `muteLocalAudioStream` of `IRtcEngine` does not take effect for channels created by the `IChannel` class, so you need to use the `muteLocalAudioStream` of the `IChannel` class instead.
- When a user joins a channel by using `joinChannel` with the `options` parameter, you can set the publishing state.
- If a user joins a channel by calling `joinChannel` with the `options` parameter, `muteLocalAudioStream` only takes effect when it is called after `joinChannel`.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.5 or later, to avoid affecting your service, Agora recommends modifying the implementation of `muteLocalAudioStream`, `publish`, and `unpublish`.

**3. startAudioMixing changes**

To avoid blocking, this release changes the `startAudioMixing` from a synchronous call to an asynchronous call.

#### Improvements

**1. Performance optimization**

Agora has optimized internal threads of the SDK, which reduces CPU usage by about 20% on low-end devices.

**2. Media Push**

To be more transparent to users about errors and events in Media Push, this release adds the following codes:

- To `onRtmpStreamingStateChanged`: Error code `RTMP_STREAM_UNPUBLISH_ERROR_OK (100)`, which reports that the streaming has been stopped normally. After you call `removePublishStreamUrl` to stop streaming, the SDK returns this error code and state code `RTMP_STREAM_PUBLISH_STATE_IDLE (0)`.
- To `onRtmpStreamingEvent`: Event code `RTMP_STREAMING_EVENT_URL_ALREADY_IN_USE (2)`, which reports that the streaming URL is already being used for Media Push. If you want to start new streaming, use a new streaming URL.

**3. Media device state**

To report media device states more accurately, this release optimizes the enumerations of `MEDIA_DEVICE_STATE_TYPE` as follows:

- Changes the definition of `MEDIA_DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE (1)` from "The device is ready for use" to "The device is in use", which is more consistent with its name.
- Adds `MEDIA_DEVICE_STATE_IDLE (0)`, which reports the device is ready for use.

`MEDIA_DEVICE_STATE_TYPE` is reported in the `onAudioDeviceStateChanged` callback.

**4. Music file state**

When you call `startAudioMixing` after `pauseAudioMixing`, this release adds the `onAudioMixingStateChanged(AUDIO_MIXING_STATE_STOPPED, AUDIO_MIXING_REASON_STOPPED_BY_USER)`state, which indicates the music file is stopped, before reporting `onAudioMixingStateChanged(AUDIO_MIXING_STATE_PLAYING, AUDIO_MIXING_REASON_STARTED_BY_USER)`.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Under poor network conditions, when you called `startAudioMixing` to play an online music file, occasionally the SDK response time was too long and caused a freeze.
- Under poor network conditions, users were occasionally unable to switch roles.

#### API changes

**Deprecated**

- `publish` and `unpublish` in `IChannel`

## v3.4.3

v3.4.3 was released on June 16, 2021. This release fixed the following issues:

- The `startAudioMixing` method could not play the MP3 local music files with the `.m4a` filename extension.
- After a user of the SDK v3.0.0+ left a communication channel that had any user of the SDK versions earlier than 3.0.0 and switched the channel profile to live streaming, the user of the SDK v3.0.0+ set user role to host before joining the next channel, but the client role setting did not take effect.
- Under certain circumstances, an audio delay occasionally occurred 10 minutes after a user joined the channel.

## v3.4.2

v3.4.2 was released on May 12, 2021. This release fixed occasional crashes after integrating the `libagora_ai_denoise_extension.dll` library.

## v3.4.1

v3.4.1 was released on April 22, 2021. This release fixed this issue: Crashes occurred in a certain voice conversion scenario.

## v3.4.0

v3.4.0 was released on April 16, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**Integration changes**

To reduce the app size after integrating the SDK, this release packages some features as extension libraries (with the `Extension` suffix). For details, see <Link to="/3.x/shared/common/reduce-app-size?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Extension libraries</Link>. If you do not need to use the related features, you can remove the corresponding extension libraries and recompile the project.

**Behavior changes**

1. Music file playback state

To monitor the reason why the playback state of a music file changes, this release modifies the `onAudioMixingStateChanged` callback as follows:

- Replaces the `errorCode` parameter with the `reason` parameter.
- Deprecates `AUDIO_MIXING_ERROR_TYPE` and replaces it with `AUDIO_MIXING_REASON_TYPE` instead. Using `AUDIO_MIXING_REASON_TYPE`, you can get the reason for the change of the playback state, such as start, pause, stop or fail.
- Modifies some logic of reporting `AUDIO_MIXING_STATE_TYPE`. For example, as of this release, when looping music, the SDK triggers the `AUDIO_MIXING_STATE_PLAYING` state when each loop is completed or starts.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.0 or later, to avoid affecting your service, Agora recommends that you modify the implementation of `onAudioMixingStateChanged`.

2. Volume control of microphone

As of this release, the `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` method only adjusts the volume of the signal captured by the microphone. If you need to adjust the volume of the signal captured by the sound card, use the `adjustLoopbackRecordingSignalVolume` method instead.

#### New features

**1. Volume control of sound cards**

This release adds the `adjustLoopbackRecordingSignalVolume` method. You can call this method after calling `enableLoopbackRecording` to adjust the volume of the signal captured by the sound card.

**2. Playback progress of audio effect files**

To control the playback progress of audio effect files, this release adds the following methods:

- `playEffect`[2/2]: Sets the playback position when starting playback of an audio effect file by using the `startPos` parameter.
- `setEffectPosition`: Sets the playback position after starting playback of an audio effect file.
- `getEffectDuration`: Gets the duration of a local audio effect file.
- `getEffectCurrentPosition`: Gets current playback progress of an audio effect file.

Also, this release deprecates the `playEffect`[1/2] method. You can use `playEffect`[2/2] instead.

#### Improvements

**1. Playback progress of music files**

To control the playback progress of music files, this release is optimized as follows:

- Deprecates the `startAudioMixing` method and adds a new method with the same name in its place. The new `startAudioMixing` method allows you to set the playback position when starting playback of a music file by using the `startPos` parameter.
- Deprecates the `getAudioMixingDuration` method and adds a new method with the same name in its place. The new `getAudioMixingDuration` method allows you to get the duration of a local music file before playing it.

**2. Audio recording**

To set the recording configuration during audio recording, this release adds a new `startAudioRecording` method and deprecates the old method with the same name. The `config` parameter of the new `startAudioRecording` method allows you to set the audio recording quality, content, sample rate, and storage path of the recording file.

This release also adds a new error code: `ERR_ALREADY_IN_RECORDING(160)`. If you call the new `startAudioRecording` method again before the current recording ends, the SDK reports this error code.

**3. Media device errors**

To help users better understand the cause of local audio errors, this release adds the following new error codes to `LOCAL_AUDIO_STREAM_ERROR`:

  - `LOCAL_AUDIO_STREAM_ERROR_NO_RECORDING_DEVICE(6)`, which indicates that the SDK cannot find the local audio-capture device.
  - `LOCAL_AUDIO_STREAM_ERROR_NO_PLAYOUT_DEVICE(7)`, which indicates that the SDK cannot find the local audio-playback device.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed this issues: the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback returned incorrect volume information after you called `enableSoundPositionIndication(true)`.

## v3.3.2

v3.3.2 was released on March 29, 2021. This release fixed the issue where the local user heard noises from the remote user when a remote user was silent for a long time under certain circumstances.

## v3.3.1

v3.3.1 was released on March 4, 2021.

#### New features

**Voice Conversion**

This release adds the `setVoiceConversionPreset` method to set a voice conversion effect (to disguise a user's voice). You can use this method to make a male-sounding voice sound steady or deep, and a female-sounding voice sound gender-neutral or sweet. See <Link to="/3.x/shared/interactive-live-streaming/voice-changer?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Set the Voice Effect</Link>.

#### Improvements

**1. AES-GCM encryption mode**

For scenarios requiring high security, to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data, and to improve the computational efficiency of data encryption, this release adds the following enumerators in `ENCRYPTION_MODE`:

- `AES_128_GCM`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.
- `AES_256_GCM`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.

<div class="alert note">Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users such as the Agora recording service.</div>


**2. Remote audio statistics**

To monitor quality of experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream, this release adds `mosValue` to `onRemoteAudioStats`, which reports the quality of the remote audio stream as determined by the Agora real-time audio MOS (Mean Opinion Score) measurement system.


#### API changes

This release adds the following APIs:
- [`setVoiceConversionPreset`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#aee9553948bf2c4e2b79a00cddce41499)
- `AES_128_GCM` and `AES_256_GCM` in [`ENCRYPTION_MODE`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/namespaceagora_1_1rtc.html#a906cebebbabf534c86ca71de0d1a4cf0)
- `mosValue` in [`RemoteAudioStats`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/structagora_1_1rtc_1_1_remote_audio_stats.html)

## v3.3.0

v3.3.0 was released on January 22, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

This release adds the Agora basic calculation framework `libagora-core.dll`. To integrate the SDK into your project, see <Link to="/3.x/shared/interactive-live-streaming/quickstart-guide/start-audio-streaming#integrate-the-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Integrate the SDK</Link>.

**2. Changes to subscribing behavior**

This release deprecates `setDefaultMuteAllRemoteAudioStreams` and changes the behavior of `mute`-related methods as follows:

- `mute`-related methods must be called after joining or switching to a channel; otherwise, the method call does not take effect.
- Methods with the prefix `muteAll` are no longer the master switch, and each `mute`-related method independently controls the user's subscribing state. When you call methods with the prefixes `muteAll` and `muteRemote` together, the method that is called later takes effect.
- Methods with the prefix `muteAll` set whether to subscribe to the audio streams of all remote users, including all subsequent users, which means methods with the prefix `muteAll` contain the function of methods with the prefix `setDefaultMute`. Agora recommends not calling methods with the prefixes `muteAll` and `setDefaultMute` together; otherwise, the setting may not take effect.

See details in <Link to="/3.x/shared/common/set-subscribing-state?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Set the Subscribing State</Link>.

**3. Changes to voice activity behavior**

In the remote users' `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback, this release changes the value of the `vad` member from always `0` to always `1`.

#### New features

**1. Channel media options**

To help developers control media subscription more flexibly, this release adds the `joinChannel` [2/2] and `switchChannel` [2/2] methods to set whether users subscribe to all remote audio streams in a channel when joining and switching channels.

**2. Cloud proxy**

To improve the usability of the Agora Cloud Proxy, this release adds the `setCloudProxy` method to set the cloud proxy and allows you to select a cloud proxy that uses the UDP protocol. For details, see <Link to="/3.x/shared/interactive-live-streaming/basic-features/use-cloud-proxy?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Cloud Proxy</Link>.

**3. Deep-learning noise reduction**

To eliminate non-stationary noise based on traditional noise reduction, this release adds `enableDeepLearningDenoise` to enable deep-learning noise reduction.

<div class="alert note"> Before enabling deep-learning noise reduction, integrate the <code>libagora_ai_denoise_extension.dll</code> dynamic library into your project files.</div>

**4. Singing beautifier**

To beautify the voice and add reverberation effects in a singing scenario, this release adds the `setVoiceBeautifierParameters` method and adds the `SINGING_BEAUTIFIER` enumeration value to `VOICE_BEAUTIFIER_PRESET`.

You can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset(SINGING_BEAUTIFIER)` to beautify the male voice and add the reverberation effect for a voice in a small room. For more settings, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierParameters`(`SINGING_BEAUTIFIER`, `param1`, `param2`) to beautify male or female voices and add reverberation effects for a voice in a small room, large room, or hall.

**5. Log files**

To ensure the integrity of log content, this release adds the `logConfig` member variable to `RtcEngineContext`. You can use `logConfig` to set the log files output by the Agora SDK when you initialize `RtcEngine`. See [How can I set the log file?](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/faq/logfile) for details.

As of v3.3.0, Agora does not recommend using the `setLogFile`, `setLogFileSize`, or `setLogFilter` methods to set the log files.

**6. Data streams**

To support scenarios such as lyrics synchronization and courseware synchronization, this release deprecates the previous `createDataStream` method and replaces it with a new method of the same name. You can use this new method to create a data stream and set whether to synchronize the data stream with the audio stream sent to the Agora channel and whether the received data is ordered.

#### Improvements

**Remote audio statistics**

To monitor quality of experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream, this release adds `qoeQuality` and `qualityChangedReason` to `onRemoteAudioStats`, which report QoE of the local user and the reason for poor QoE, respectively.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, local users could not play remote audio streams.
- 360 Brain of Security (online shopping mode) automatically blocked the application program from running.

#### API changes

## v3.2.1

v3.2.1 was released on December 17, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

- Crashes occurred when using IPv6.
- When Native clients integrated with the Agora Voice SDK interoperated with Web clients, the Web clients continuously reported the `Client.on(disable-local-video)` or `Client.on(mute-video)` callback.

## v3.2.0

v3.2.0 was released on November 30, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

Since v3.2.0, the following files have been added to the SDK package:

- `libagora-fdkaac.dll`: The Fraunhofer FDK AAC dynamic library.
- `libagora-mpg123.dll`: The mpg123 dynamic library.
- `libagora-soundtouch.dll`: The SoundTouch dynamic library.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.2.0 or later, ensure that you have copied the above files to the folder where the `libagora-rtc-sdk.dll` file is located.

**2. Cloud proxy**

This release optimizes the Agora cloud proxy architecture. If you are already using cloud proxy, to avoid compatibility issues between the new SDK and the old cloud proxy, please contact support@agora.io before upgrading the SDK. See <Link to="/3.x/shared/interactive-live-streaming/basic-features/use-cloud-proxy?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Cloud Proxy</Link>.

**3. Security and compliance**

Agora has passed ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO 27018 international certifications, providing safe and reliable real-time interactive cloud services for users worldwide. See <Link to="/3.x/shared/interactive-live-streaming/reference/security#iso-certificates?platform={{platform.PATH}}">ISO Certificates</Link>.

This release supports transport layer encryption by adding TLS (Transport Layer Security) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) encryption methods.

<div class="alert note">Transport layer encryption affects the size of the SDK package. For details, see <i>Product Overview</i>.</div>

#### New features

**Interactive Live Streaming Standard**

This release adds `setClientRole` for setting the latency level of an audience member. You can use this method to switch between Interactive Live Streaming Premium and Interactive Live Streaming Standard as follows:

- Set the latency level as ultra low latency to use Interactive Live Streaming Premium.
- Set the latency level as low latency to use Interactive Live Streaming Standard.

For details, see the [product overview](product-overview) of Interactive Live Streaming Standard. 

#### Improvements

**1. Meeting scenario**

To improve the audio experience for multi-person meetings, this release adds `AUDIO_SCENARIO_MEETING(8)` in `setAudioProfile`.

**2. Voice beautifier and audio effects**

To improve the usability of the APIs related to voice beautifier and audio effects, this release deprecates `setLocalVoiceChanger` and `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`, and adds the following methods instead:

- `setVoiceBeautifierPreset`: Compared with `setLocalVoiceChanger`, this method deletes audio effects such as a little boy’s voice and a more spatially resonant voice.
- `setAudioEffectPreset`: Compared with `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`, this method adds audio effects such as the 3D voice, the pitch correction, a little boy’s voice and a more spatially resonant voice.
- `setAudioEffectParameters`: This method sets detailed parameters for a specified audio effect. In this release, the supported audio effects are the 3D voice and pitch correction.

**3. Interactive streaming delay**

This release reduces the latency on the audience's client during an interactive live streaming by about 500 ms.

#### API changes

**Added**

- [`setAudioEffectPreset`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a6111d2648909601c976b0190fe6de798)

If you have specified a region for connection when calling [`initialize`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#ac71db65e66942e4e0a0550e95c16890f), ensure that you use the latest area code when migrating from an earlier SDK version.

## v3.1.0

v3.1.0 was released on Aug 11, 2020.

#### New features

**1. Publishing and subscription states**

This release adds the following callbacks to report the current publishing and subscribing states:

- `onAudioPublishStateChanged`: Reports the change of the audio publishing state.
- `onAudioSubscribeStateChanged`: Reports the change of the audio subscribing state.

**2. First local frame published callback**

This release adds the `onFirstLocalAudioFramePublished` callback to report that the first audio frame is published. The `onFirstLocalAudioFrame` callback is deprecated from v3.1.0.

**3. Custom data report**

This release adds the `sendCustomReportMessage` method for reporting customized messages. To try out this function, contact support@agora.io and discuss the format of customized messages with us.

#### Improvement

**1. Regional connection**

This release adds the following regions for regional connection. After you specify the region for connection, your app that integrates the Agora SDK connects to the Agora servers within that region.

- `AREA_CODE_JAPAN`: Japan.
- `AREA_CODE_INDIA`: India.

**2. Media Push**

To improve the user experience in Media Push, this release adds the `onRtmpStreamingEvent` callback to report events during Media Push, such as failure to add a background image or watermark image.

**3. Encryption**

This release adds the `enableEncryption` method for enabling built-in encryption, and deprecates the following methods:

- `setEncryptionSecret`
- `setEncryptionMode`

**4. More in-call statistics**

This release adds the following attributes to provide more in-call statistics:

- Adds `txPacketLossRate` in `LocalAudioStats`, which represents the audio packet loss rate (%) from the local client to the Agora edge server before applying anti-packet loss strategies.
- Adds `publishDuration` in `RemoteAudioStats`, which represents the total publish duration (ms) of the remote media stream.

**5. Audio profile**

To improve audio performance, this release adjusts the maximum audio bitrate of each audio profile as follows:

| Profile |  v3.1.0 |  Earlier than v3.1.0  |
|---|---|---|
| `AUDIO_PROFILE_DEFAULT`   | <li>For the interactive streaming profile: 64 Kbps</li><li>For the communication profile: 16 Kbps</li>   |  <li>For the interactive streaming profile: 52 Kbps</li><li>For the communication profile: 16 Kbps</li>  |
| `AUDIO_PROFILE_SPEECH_STANDARD`   | 18 Kbps   |  18 Kbps  |
| `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD`   | 64 Kbps   | 48 Kbps   |
| `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD_STEREO`  |  80 Kbps | 56 Kbps   |
| `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY`  |  96 Kbps  | 128 Kbps   |
| `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY_STEREO`  | 128 Kbps   |  192 Kbps  |

**6. Log files**

This release increases the default number of log files that the Agora SDK outputs from 2 to 5, and increases the default size of each log file from 512 KB to 1024 KB. By default, the SDK outputs five log files, `agorasdk.log`, `agorasdk_1.log`, `agorasdk_2.log`, `agorasdk_3.log`, `agorasdk_4.log`. The SDK writes the latest logs in `agorasdk.log`. When `agorasdk.log` is full, the SDK deletes the log file with the earliest modification time among the other four, renames `agorasdk.log` to the name of the deleted log file, and creates a new `agorasdk.log` to record the latest logs.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the occasional howling issue on some Huawei laptops.

## v3.0.1

v3.0.1 was released on May 27, 2020.

#### New features

**1. Audio mixing pitch**

To set the pitch of the local music file during audio mixing, this release adds `setAudioMixingPitch`. You can set the `pitch` parameter to increase or decrease the pitch of the music file. This method sets the pitch of the local music file only. It does not affect the pitch of a human voice.

**2. Voice enhancement**

To improve the audio quality, this release adds the following enumerate elements in `setLocalVoiceChanger` and `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`:

- `VOICE_CHANGER_PRESET` adds several elements that have the prefixes `VOICE_BEAUTY` and `GENERAL_BEAUTY_VOICE`. The `VOICE_BEAUTY` elements enhance the local voice, and the `GENERAL_BEAUTY_VOICE` enumerations add gender-based enhancement effects.
- `AUDIO_REVERB_PRESET` adds the enumeration `AUDIO_VIRTUAL_STEREO` and several enumerations that have the prefix `AUDIO_REVERB_FX`. The `AUDIO_VIRTUAL_STEREO` enumeration implements reverberation in the virtual stereo, and the `AUDIO_REVERB_FX` enumerations implement additional enhanced reverberation effects.

See the advanced guide [Set the Voice Changer and Reverberation Effects](voice_changer_windows) for more information.

**3. Data post-processing in multiple channels**

This release adds support for post-processing remote audio data in a multi-channel scenario by adding `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted` and `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx` in the `IAudioFrameObserver` class.

After successfully registering the audio observer, if you set the return value of `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted` as `true`, you can get the corresponding audio data from `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`. In a multi-channel scenario, Agora recommends setting the return value as `true`.


#### Fixed issues

- Audio mixing issues and abnormal loopback test results.
- Inaccurate report of the [`onClientRoleChanged`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#a36d3f45184cbb37ed2c4846654a14368) callback, authentication with an App ID and token, and a garbled log directory.

## v3.0.0.2

v3.0.0.2 was released on Apr 22, 2020.

#### New features

**Specifying the area of connection**

This release adds `areaCode` member in the `RtcEngineContext` struct for specifying the area of connection when creating an `IRtcEngine` instance. This advanced feature applies to scenarios that have regional restrictions. You can choose from areas including Mainland China, North America, Europe, Asia (excluding Mainland China), and global (default).

After specifying the area of connection:

- When the app that integrates the Agora SDK is used within the specified area, it connects to the Agora servers within the specified area under normal circumstances.
- When the app that integrates the Agora SDK is used out of the specified area, it connects to the Agora servers either in the specified area or in the area where the SDK is located.

#### API changes

**Added**

`areaCode` member in the [`RtcEngineContext`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/structagora_1_1rtc_1_1_rtc_engine_context.html) struct

## v3.0.0

v3.0.0 was released on Mar 5, 2020.

In this release, Agora improves the user experience under poor network conditions for both the `COMMUNICATION`and `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profiles through the following measures:
- Adopting a new architecture for the `COMMUNICATION` profile.
- Upgrading the last-mile network strategy for both the `COMMUNICATION`and `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profiles,  which enhances the SDK's anti-packet-loss capacity by maximizing the net bitrate when the uplink and downlink bandwidth are insufficient.

To deal with any incompatibility issues caused by the architecture change, Agora uses the fallback mechanism to ensure that users of different versions of the SDKs can communicate with each other: if a user joins the channel from a client using a previous version, all clients using v3.0.0 automatically fall back to the older version. This has the effect that none of the users in the channel can enjoy the improved experience. Therefore we strongly recommend upgrading all your clients to v3.0.0.

We also upgrade the On-premise Recording SDK to v3.0.0. Ensure that you upgrade your On-premise Recording SDK to v3.0.0 so that all users can enjoy the improvements brought by the new architecture and network strategy.

#### New features

**1. Multiple channel management**

To enable a user to join an unlimited number of channels at a time, this release adds the `IChannel` and `IChannelEventHandler` classes. By creating multiple `IChannel` objects, a user can join the corresponding channels at the same time.
After joining multiple channels, users can receive the audio and video streams of all the channels, but publish one stream to only one channel at a time. This feature applies to scenarios where users need to receive streams from multiple channels, or frequently switch between channels to publish streams. See [Join Multiple Channels](multiple_channel_windows) for details.

**2. Adjusting the playback volume of the specified remote user**

Adds `adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` for adjusting the playback volume of a specified remote user. You can call this method as many times as necessary in a call or interactive live streaming to adjust the playback volume of different remote users, or to repeatedly adjust the playback volume of the same remote user.

#### Improvements

**1. Audio profiles**

To meet the need for higher audio quality, this release adjusts the corresponding audio profile of `AUDIO_PROFILE_DEFAULT (0)` in the `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile.

| SDK   | AUDIO_PROFILE_DEFAULT (0)                                   |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| v3.0.0      | A sample rate of 48 kHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 52 Kbps. |
| Earlier than v3.0.0 | 3A sample rate of 32 kHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 64 Kbps. |

**2. Quality statistics**

Adds the following members in the `RtcStats` class for providing more in-call statistics, making it easier to monitor the call quality and memory usage in real time:

- `gatewayRtt`
- `memoryAppUsageRatio`
- `memoryTotalUsageRatio`
- `memoryAppUsageInKbytes`

**3. Others**

This release enables interoperability between the RTC Native SDK and the RTC Web SDK by default, and deprecates the `enableWebSdkInteroperability` method.

#### Issues fixed

* Audio issues relating to audio mixing, audio encoding, and echoing.
* Other issues relating to app crashes, log file, and unstable service during Media Push.

#### API changes

## v2.9.1

~18635170-57d7-11ec-8689-2164ade84c59~

v2.9.1 is released on Sep 19, 2019.

#### New features

**Detecting local voice activity**

This release adds the `report_vad(bool)` parameter to the [`enableAudioVolumeIndication`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a4b30a8ff1ae50c4c114ae4f909c4ebcb) method to enable local voice activity detection. Once it is enabled, you can check the [`AudioVolumeInfo`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/structagora_1_1rtc_1_1_audio_volume_info.html) struct of the [`onAudioVolumeIndication`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#aab1184a2b276f509870c055a9ff8fac4) callback for the voice activity status of the local user.

#### Improvements

**Supporting more audio sample rates for recording**

To enable more audio sample rate options for recording, this release adds a new [`startAudioRecording`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a3c05d82c97a9d63ebda116b9a1e5ca3f) method with a `sampleRate` parameter. In the new method, you can set the sample rate as 16, 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz. The original method supports only a fixed sample rate of 32 kHz and is deprecated.

#### Issues fixed

**Miscellaneous**

A typo in the IAgoraRtcEngine.h file.

#### API changes

To improve the user experience, we made the following changes in v2.9.1:

**Added**

- [`startAudioRecording`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a3c05d82c97a9d63ebda116b9a1e5ca3f)
- The `report_vad` parameter in the [`enableAudioVolumeIndication`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a4b30a8ff1ae50c4c114ae4f909c4ebcb) method
- The `vad` member in the [`AudioVolumeInfo`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/structagora_1_1rtc_1_1_audio_volume_info.html) class

**Deprecated**

- `startAudioRecording`

## v2.9.0

v2.9.0 is released on Aug 16, 2019.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Media Push**

In this release, we deleted the following methods:

- `configPublisher`

If your app implements Media Push with the methods above, ensure that you upgrade the SDK to the latest version and use the following methods for the same function:

- [`setLiveTranscoding`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a0601e4671357dc1ec942cccc5a6a1dde)
- [`addPublishStreamUrl`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a5d62a13bd8391af83fb4ce123450f839)
- [`removePublishStreamUrl`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a30e6c64cb616fbd78bedd8c516c320e7)
- [`onRtmpStreamingStateChanged`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#a29754dc9d527cbff57dbc55067e3287d)


**2. Disabling/enabling the local audio**

To improve the audio quality in the `COMMUNICATION` profile, this release sets the system volume to the media volume after you call the `enableLocalAudio`(true) method. Calling `enableLocalAudio`(false) switches the system volume back to the in-call volume.

#### New features

**1. Faster switching to another channel**

This release adds the [`switchChannel`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a3eb5ee494ce124b34609c593719c89ab) method to enable the audience in a `LIVE_BROADCASTING` channel to quickly switch to another channel. With this method, you can achieve a much faster switch than with the `leaveChannel` and `joinChannel` methods. After the audience successfully switches to another channel by calling the `switchChannel` method, the SDK triggers the `onLeaveChannel` and `onJoinChannelSuccess` callbacks to indicate that the audience has left the original channel and joined a new one.

**2. Channel media stream relay**

This release adds the following methods to relay the media streams of a host from a source channel to a destination channel. This feature applies to scenarios such as online singing contests, where hosts of different `LIVE_BROADCASTING` channels interact with each other.

- [`startChannelMediaRelay`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#acb72f911830a6fdb77e0816d7b41dd5c)
- [`updateChannelMediaRelay`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#afad0d3f3861c770200a884b855276663)
- [`stopChannelMediaRelay`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#ab4a1c52a83a08f7dacab6de36f4681b8)

During the media stream relay, the SDK reports the states and events of the relay with the [`onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#a8f22b85194d4b771bbab0e1c3b505b22) and [`onChannelMediaRelayEvent`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#a89a4085f36c25eeed75c129c82ca9429) callbacks.

**3. Reporting the local and remote audio state**

This release adds the [`onLocalAudioStateChanged`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#a9296c329331eb83b3af1315c52e7f91a) and [`onRemoteAudioStateChanged`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#aa168380f86f1dc2df1c269a785c56612) callbacks to report the local and remote audio states. With these callbacks, the SDK reports the following states for the local and remote audio:

- The local audio: STOPPED(0), RECORDING(1), ENCODING(2), or FAILED(3). When the state is FAILED(3), see the `error` parameter for troubleshooting.
- The remote audio: STOPPED(0), STARTING(1), DECODING(2), FROZEN(3), or FAILED(4). See the `reason` parameter for why the remote audio state changes.

**4. Reporting the local audio statistics**

This release adds the [`onLocalAudioStats`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#a0cb47df6a8ef7acee229eb307d6f32c3) callback to report the statistics of the local audio during a call, including the number of channels, the sending sample rate, and the average sending bitrate of the local audio.

#### Improvements

**1. Reporting more statistics of the in-call quality**

This release adds the following statistics in the `RtcStats` class:

- [`RtcStats`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/structagora_1_1rtc_1_1_rtc_stats.html): The total number of the sent audio bytes and  received audio bytes during a session.

**2. Other Improvements**

- Improves the audio quality when the audio scenario is set to Game Streaming.
- Improves the audio quality after the user disables the microphone in the `COMMUNICATION` profile.

#### Issues fixed

**Audio**

- When interoperating with a Web app, voice distortion occurs after the native app enables the remote sound position indication.
- Invalid call of the `muteRemoteAudioStream` method.
- Occasionally no audio.

**Miscellaneous**

- Occasionally mixed streams in Media Push.
- Occasional crashes occur.
- Failure to join the channel.

#### API changes

To improve the user experience, we made the following changes in v2.9.0:

**Added**

## v2.8.0

v2.8.0 is released on Jul. 8, 2019.

#### New features

**1. Supporting string user IDs**

Many apps use string user IDs. This release adds the following methods to enable apps to join an Agora channel directly with string user IDs as user accounts:

- [registerLocalUserAccount](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a0d44b74ced4005ee86353c13186f870d)
- [joinChannelWithUserAccount](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#a14f8c308c6c57c55653552b939a8527a)

For other methods, Agora uses the integer uid parameter. The Agora Engine maintains a mapping table that contains the user ID and string user account, and you can get the corresponding user account or ID by calling the getUserInfoByUid or getUserInfoByUserAccount method.

To ensure smooth call, use the same parameter type to identify all users within a channel, that is, all users should use either the integer user ID or the string user account to join a channel.

#### Note:
- Do not mix parameter types within the same channel. The following Agora SDKs support string user accounts:
	- The Native SDK: v2.8.0 and later.
	- The Web SDK: v2.5.0 and later.

 If you use SDKs that do not support string user accounts, only integer user IDs can be used in the channel.
- If you change your user IDs into string user accounts, ensure that all app clients are upgraded to the latest version.
- If you use string user accounts, ensure that the token generation script on your server is updated to the latest version. If you join the channel with a user account, ensure that you use the same user account or its corresponding integer user ID to generate a token. Call the `getUserInfoByUserAccount` method to get the user ID that corresponds to the user account.

**2. Adding remote audio statistics**

To monitor the audio transmission quality during a call interactive live streaming, this release adds the `totalFrozenTime` and `frozenRate` members in the [RemoteAudioStats](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/structagora_1_1rtc_1_1_remote_audio_stats.html) class, to report the audio freeze time and freeze rate of the remote user.

This release also adds the `numChannels`, `receivedSampleRate`, and `receivedBitrate` members in the [RemoteAudioStats](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/structagora_1_1rtc_1_1_remote_audio_stats.html) class.

#### Improvements

This release adds a `CONNECTION_CHANGED_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT(14)` member to the `reason` parameter of the [onConnectionStateChanged](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/API%20Reference/cpp/classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine_event_handler.html#af409b2e721d345a65a2c600cea2f5eb4) callback. This member indicates a connection state change caused by the timeout of the connection keep-alive between the SDK and Agora's edge server.

#### API changes
