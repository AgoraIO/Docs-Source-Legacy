This page provides the release notes for the Agora Voice SDK for iOS.

## Known issues and limitations

#### Compatibility with iOS 15

As of v3.4.6, the SDK supports iOS 15. For the SDK versions between v3.2.0 and v3.4.5 inclusive, crashes occur on iOS 15. To fix this issue, upgrade the SDK to v3.4.6 or later.

<ReleaseNote />

## v3.7.1

v3.7.1 was released on August 4, 2022.

#### Improvements

**1. Co-hosting across channels**

This release enhances the connection mechanism between the SDK and the server of co-hosting across channels and therefore reduces the failure rate.


#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes occurred.
- The local user received the `remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid(2,6)` callback after disconnecting from and reconnecting to a network even though the remote user had not changed the audio state.
- [gatewayRtt](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt) reported by the [reportRtcStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportRtcStats:) callback was inaccurate when the network latency was too high or the router did not respond to ICMP packets.
- Occasional crashes occurred when you called `playEffect` or `startAudioMixing` to play 8-bit PCM-encoded audio in the WAV format.
- The local audio error reason reported by the `localAudioStateChange` callback after a user denied microphone permission was inaccurate.
- Occasionally, it took users longer than normal to join a channel for the first time.

## v3.7.0.2

v3.7.0.2 was released on June 6, 2022 and improved the stability of the SDK.

## v3.7.0

v3.7.0 was released on April 11, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**Optimized integration with Swift API**

Swift developers automatically convert the Objective-C API provided by the Agora SDK to the Swift API by using Xcode for integration development. To avoid API semantic confusion due to automatic conversion, this release uses the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro to explicitly define the name of the Swift API for each Objective-C API in the header files.

When you use the Swift API, note that the following Swift API names defined by Agora do not match the Swift API names automatically converted by Xcode:

| Agora Objective-C API                                        | Swift API defined by Agora                                   | Swift API automatically converted by Xcode                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| - (BOOL)onRecordAudioFrame:(AgoraAudioFrame* _Nonnull)frame; in the `AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol`protocol | func onRecordAudioFrame(_ frame: AgoraAudioFrame) -> Bool {} | func onRecord(_ frame: AgoraAudioFrame) -> Bool {}           |



#### New features

**1. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the feature of spatial audio effect, which can add a sense of space to remote users' audio and simulate the audio transmission process in the real world. This enables the local user to hear remote users with the spatial audio effect.

To use this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).


**2. Local voice pitch**

This release adds the `enableLocalVoicePitchCallback` method and the `reportLocalVoicePitchFrequency` callback, to allow the SDK to report the voice pitch of the local user at the set time interval to the app.


**3. Reporting the user role switch failure**

This release adds the `didClientRoleChangeFailed` callback to report the reason for a user role switch failure and the current user role in the interactive live streaming.

**4. Reasons for connection state changes**

To help users better understand the cause of connection state changes, this release adds the following enumerators in `AgoraConnectionChangedReason`:

- `AgoraConnectionChangedSameUidLogin(19)`: Join the same channel from different devices using the same user ID.
- `AgoraConnectionChangedTooManyBroadcasters(20)`: The number of hosts in the channel reaches the upper limit. This enumerator is reported only after the support for 128 hosts is enabled.

#### Improvements

**1. Channel capacity improvement**

As of this release, a single channel can support up to 128 concurrent online hosts, who can publish audio streams at the same time. The number of audience members in a channel is unlimited. Each host or audience member can subscribe to a maximum of 50 hosts at the same time.

To experience this improvement, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).


**2. A new version of deep-learning noise reduction**

Agora has added the option of using a new version of deep-learning noise reduction to further improve audio quality. To experience this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io)

**3. playEffect improvements**

This release improves the internal implementation logic of `playEffect` to avoid blocking and reduce freezing when playing an audio effect file.

**4. Audio experience optimization**

This release reduces audio stuttering under network conditions with burst jitter and high packet loss.

**5. Transmission upgrade**

This release upgrades transmission protocols and algorithms to enhance the SDK‘s ability to counter poor network conditions.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed an issue where the app occasionally failed to rejoin a channel after a user left a channel and put the app in the background for a period of time.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableLocalVoicePitchCallback`
- `reportLocalVoicePitchFrequency`
- `didClientRoleChangeFailed`
- `AgoraConnectionChangedSameUidLogin(19)` and `AgoraConnectionChangedTooManyBroadcasters(20)` in `AgoraConnectionChangedReason`


**Deprecated**

- Warning code `AgoraWarningCodeSetClientRoleNotAuthorized(119)`, use `AgoraClientRoleChangeFailedReason` instead.


## v3.6.2

v3.6.2 was released on February 22, 2022.


#### New features

**1. Removing extension libraries when using CocoaPods**

Extension libraries are dynamic libraries that can be optionally integrated into a project. As of v3.6.2, when you integrate the iOS SDK with CocoaPods, Agora supports reducing the size of your app after integrating the SDK by using the `subspecs` field in the Podfile to specify the desired dynamic libraries and exclude unnecessary extension libraries. For details about the sample code and the `subspecs` fields, see [Reduce App Size](../best-practices/reduce-app-size).


#### Improvements

**1. Cloud proxy**

To enrich application scenarios of the Agora Cloud Proxy, this release updates the cloud proxy types (`proxyType`) as follows:

- Changes the meaning of `AgoraNoneProxy(0)` from "Do not use the cloud proxy" to "Automatic mode". In this mode, the SDK attempts a direct connection to SD-RTN™ and automatically switches to TLS 443 if the attempt fails. As of v3.6.2, the SDK has this mode enabled by default.
- Adds `AgoraTcpProxy(2)`, which is the TCP (encrypted) mode. In this mode, the SDK always transmits data over TLS 443.

In addition, this release adds the `didProxyConnected` callback to report the proxy connection state. For example, when a user calls `setCloudProxy` and joins a channel successfully, the SDK triggers this callback to report the user ID, the proxy type connected, and the time elapsed from the user calling `joinChannelByToken` until this callback is triggered.


**2. Audio recording**

This release extends `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` with support for setting recording with dual channels and higher audio quality.

- By adding `recordingChannel` to `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration`, it enables you to set the recorded audio channel to be mono or dual. Because the actual recorded audio channel is related to the captured audio channel and the integration scheme affects the final recorded audio channel, contact technical support for assistance with stereo recording using `startAudioRecordingWithConfig`.
- By adding `AgoraAudioRecordingQualityUltraHigh(3)` to `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration.recordingQuality`, it enables you to set the recorded audio quality to ultra-high. Ultra-high quality is the highest quality available in `recordingQuality`. When you record a 10-minute AAC audio file at a sample rate of 32,000 Hz and ultra-high quality, the file size is approximately 7.5 MB.


**3. Music file playback**

This release optimizes the experience of calling `startAudioMixing` to play music files as follows:

- Reduces issues of audio freezes or no audio when playing music files.
- Increases the accuracy of the audio duration reported by `getAudioFileInfo`.
- Supports more audio file formats. See [Which audio file formats does the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> support](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/general-product-inquiry/audio_format).


If you want to experience these improvements, ensure that you have integrated the `AgoraFullAudioFormatExtension.xcframework` dynamic library. Given the large size of this library, if you have limitations on app size and do not need these improvements, you can remove this dynamic library when integrating the SDK. For more instructions, see [Reduce App Size](../best-practices/reduce-app-size).


**4. Audio file formats**

This release adds support for playing audio files in the following formats:

- Mono-track online files in MP4 format.
- Multi-track online files in M4A and MP4 formats.

For online MP4 and M4A files, the MOOV atom must be before the MDAT atom.


**5. Audio device errors**

To convey the impact of a system call on the audio sampling, this release adds `AgoraAudioLocalErrorInterrupted(8)` in `AgoraAudioLocalError`, which reports that the audio sampling is interrupted by a system call.


#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- When playing a specific audio file in the WAV format with the `startAudioMixing` method, there was no sound after a certain period of playback.
- Audio stuttered under high jitter networks.
- Under poor network conditions, you could receive the `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged` callback only after a three-second delay after a successful call to `startAudioMixing`.
- Occasional crashes.


#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableWirelessAccelerate`
- `wlAccStats`
- `wlAccMessage`
- `recordingChannel` in `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration`
- `AgoraAudioRecordingQualityUltraHigh(3)` in `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration.recordingQuality`
- `didProxyConnected`
- `AgoraTcpProxy(2)` in `AgoraCloudProxyType`
- `AgoraAudioLocalErrorInterrupted(8)` in `AgoraAudioLocalError`


**Modified**

- The behavior of `AgoraNoneProxy(0)` in `AgoraCloudProxyType`.


## v3.6.1.1

v3.6.1.1 was released on January 16, 2022. 

This release fixed the following audio issue:

When an end user muted and unmuted audio from an application using the Agora Web SDK, end users using an application with Native SDK version 3.6.0 might not hear audio from this end user.

## v3.6.1

v3.6.1 was released on January 14, 2022.

This release fixed the following issues:

- The CDN live streaming failed because of the abnormal resolution of the RTMP streaming URL with a port number.
- Occasional crashes occurred.
- The `startAudioMixing` method call failed to play local iTunes music files starting with `"ipod-library://"`.


## v3.6.0.1

v3.6.0.1 was released on December 10, 2021.

This release fixed the issue that v3.6.0 incorrectly renamed the dynamic library `Agorafdkaac.xcframework` to `AgoraFDKAACExtension.xcframework`.

## v3.6.0

v3.6.0 was released on December 7, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**Media Push**

To reduce the difficulty of integrating Media Push, this release optimizes the API design of Media Push and improves the handling of network issues within Media Push clients and servers. You can experience the optimized Media Push functionality with the following new methods:

- `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscoding`: Starts pushing media streams to a CDN without transcoding. This method works the same as the old method `addPublishStreamUrl(NO)`.
- `startRtmpStreamWithTranscoding`: Starts pushing media streams to a CDN and sets the transcoding configuration. This method works the same as calling the old methods `setLiveTranscoding` and `addPublishStreamUrl(YES)` in sequence.
- `updateRtmpTranscoding`: Updates the transcoding configuration. This method works the same as the non-first call to the old method `setLiveTranscoding`.
- `stopRtmpStream`: Stops pushing media streams to a CDN. This method works the same as the old method `removePublishStreamUrl`.

This release deprecates three old methods for Media Push: `addPublishStreamUrl`, `setLiveTranscoding`, and `removePublishStreamUrl`. Agora recommends that you use the new methods for Media Push and update your code logic by referring to [Media Push](/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/media-push).

Also, as of this release, whether you use the new or old methods for Media Push, you can experience the following improvements:

- Reporting streaming states, errors, and events:

    - In the `AgoraRtmpStreamingState` state code, adding `AgoraRtmpStreamingStateDisconnecting(5)`: The SDK is disconnecting from the Agora streaming server and CDN. When you call `remove` or `stop` to stop the streaming normally, the SDK reports the streaming state as `Disconnecting`, `Idle` in sequence.
    - Adding the following to the `AgoraRtmpStreamingErrorCode` error code:
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorNotBroadcaster(11)`: The user role is not host, so the user cannot use the Media Push function. Check your application code logic.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorTranscodingNoMixStream(13)`: The `update` or `setLiveTranscoding` method is called to update the transcoding configuration in a scenario where there is streaming without transcoding. Check your application code logic.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorNetDown(14)`: Errors occurred in the host's network.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorInvalidAppId(15)`: Your App ID does not have permission to use the Media Push function. Refer to [Prerequisites](/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/media-push#prerequisites) to enable the Media Push permission.
    - Adding the following to the `AgoraRtmpStreamingEvent` event code:
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamingEventAdvancedFeatureNotSupport(3)`: The feature is not supported.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamingEventRequestTooOften(4)`: Reserved.

    <div class="alert note">To ensure the quality of the Media Push, make sure to handle the business logic according to the state code, error code, and event code.</div>

- Using the HE-AAC v2 audio codec during streaming with transcoding: This is achieved by adding `AgoraAudioCodecProfileHEAACv2` to `AgoraAudioCodecProfileType`.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- When the host in the channel switched their role to `AgoraClientRoleAudience` and then back to `AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster`, the audience heard the host's voice with a voice change effect.
- After a user played music with a third-party music player and set the audio scenario to `AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoomGaming`, joining a channel could interrupt the music played by the third-party music player.
- When you were playing an original song, calling `setAudioMixingPitch` to adjust the pitch caused the played song to switch to accompaniment. 

#### API changes

## v3.5.2

v3.5.2 was released on November 25, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Error codes returned when the request to join a channel is rejected**

To more accurately report the reason for the failure to join a channel, as of this release, the SDK returns the error code `-17(AgoraErrorCodeJoinChannelRejected)` in the return value of the joining channel method in the following situations:

- When a user who has already joined an `AgoraRtcEngineKit` channel calls the joining channel method of the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` class with a valid channel name.
- When a user who has already joined an `AgoraRtcChannel` channel calls the joining channel method of this `AgoraRtcChannel` object.

In the SDK earlier than v3.5.2, when the above errors occur, the SDK might report the error code `17` through the `didOccurError` callback, or return the error code `-5(AgoraErrorCodeRefused)` in the return value of the joining channel method.

**2. Selecting Bluetooth profiles**

To ensure connectivity with Bluetooth headsets, as of this release, when a user in the communication profile or a host in the interactive live streaming profile uses a Bluetooth headset, the SDK checks whether the device supports the Hands-Free Profile (HFP), and selects the Bluetooth profile based on the result as follows:

- On a device that supports HFP, the SDK uses HFP, where the audio is captured and played through the Bluetooth headset.
- On a device that does not support HFP, the SDK changes to the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), where the audio is captured through device's microphone and played through the Bluetooth headset.

#### New features

**Testing audio call loop**

To check whether the local audio device and network conditions can guarantee the proper sending and receiving of audio streams, this release adds the `startEchoTestWithConfig` method. You can call this method before joining a channel to test whether the loop of a user's audio device and network conditions are working properly.

Compared to `startEchoTestWithInterval`, `startEchoTestWithConfig` can secure the test, but cannot support setting the time interval for reporting test results.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the issues that when a user called `startAudioMixing` on some Android devices, remote users heard slightly unsynchronized voice and music.

#### API changes

This release adds the [`startEchoTestWithConfig`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x//Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startEchoTestWithConfig:) method.

## v3.5.1

v3.5.1 was released on October 14, 2021.

#### New features

**1. Pausing and resuming the media stream relay across channels**

In order to enable the host to quickly pause or resume a cross-channel media stream relay, this release adds the following methods and event code:

- `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay`: Pauses the media stream relay to all destination channels.
- `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`: Resumes the media stream relay to all destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`(12): The SDK successfully pauses relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`(13): The SDK fails to pause relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`(14): The SDK successfully resumes relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`(15): The SDK fails to resume relaying the media stream to destination channels.

After a successful method call of `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay` or `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`, the SDK triggers the `didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent` callback to report whether the media stream relay is successfully paused or resumed.

**2. Pushing the external audio frame to a specified position**

To meet the different processing requirements of external audio frames in different scenarios, this release deprecates `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [1/2] and `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [1/2], and adds `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [2/2] and `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [2/2] with `sourcePos`instead. You can push the external audio frame to one of three positions: after audio capture, before audio encoding, or before local playback. For example, in the KTV scenario, you can push the singing voice to after audio capture, and push the accompaniment to before audio encoding, so that the singing voice is processed by the SDK audio module, but the accompaniment is not affected by the SDK audio module.

This release also adds `setExternalAudioSourceVolume`, which enables you to set the volume of external audio frames at a specified position.

**3. Advanced settings of the music file**

To set the playback speed, audio track, and channel mode of a music file, this release adds the following methods:

- `setAudioMixingPlaybackSpeed`: Sets the playback speed of the current music file. Agora recommends a value range of [50,400], where 100 represents the original speed.
- `getAudioTrackCount`: Gets the number of audio tracks of the current music file.
- `selectAudioTrack`: Specifies the playback audio track of the current music file. The range of index is [0, getAudioTrackCount()).
- `setAudioMixingDualMonoMode`: Sets the channel mode of the current music file to original mode, left channel mode, right channel mode, or mixed channel mode.

**4. Getting audio file information**

To get the information of any audio file, this release deprecates `getAudioMixingDuration` and adds `getAudioFileInfo` instead. After joining a channel, you can call `getAudioFileInfo`and get information such as duration for the specified audio file in `didRequestAudioFileInfo`.

#### Improvements

**1. Identification and quality testing for 5G mobile networks**

This release adds identification and connection quality testing for 5G mobile networks:

- Adds `AgoraNetworkTypeMobile5G (6)` to `AgoraNetworkType`. When the local network changes to 5G, the SDK triggers the `networkTypeChangedToType` callback to report this network connection type.
- Supports calling `enableLastmileTest` or `startLastmileProbeTest` to test the connection quality of the 5G mobile network.

**2. Other improvements**

This release also provides the following improvements:

- Adds continuous optimization of the portrait edge effect of the virtual background.
- After enabling deep-learning noise reduction, the audio experience is improved when using some Bluetooth headsets.

#### Fixed issues

This release has fixed the following issues:

- In the `AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming` scenario, occasional echo or noise that was caused by inaccurate music detection occurred.
- When `pauseAudioMixing` was called before playing an audio file, and then `startAudioMixing` was called to play the audio file, playback failed.
- When the local user called `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams` and received `onRemoteAudioStateChanged (AgoraAudioRemoteReasonLocalMuted)`, `onRemoteAudioStateChanged (AgoraAudioRemoteReasonRemoteMuted)` was incorrectly received after 15 seconds.
- Crashes occasionally occurred in audio scenarios.
- The local user occasionally could not hear remote users after calling `setAudioSessionOperationRestriction`.
- As of v3.4.5, the return value was inaccurate when you called `joinChannelByToken` multiple times in a row.
- The method call of `enableExternalAudioSourceWithSampleRate` before joining the channel did not take effect. 
- The SDK additionally triggered the `localAudioStateChange` callback to report `AgoraAudioLocalStateRecording(1)` when you called `enableLocalAudio(NO)` after joining a channel.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay`
- `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`
- The following enumerators in `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEvent`:
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`
- `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [2/2]
- `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [2/2]
- `setExternalAudioSourceVolume`
- `setAudioMixingPlaybackSpeed`
- `getAudioTrackCount`
- `selectAudioTrack`
- `setAudioMixingDualMonoMode`
- `getAudioFileInfo`
- `didRequestAudioFileInfo`
- `AgoraNetworkTypeMobile5G` in `AgoraNetworkType`

**Deprecated**

- `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [1/2]
- `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [1/2]
- `getAudioMixingDuration`

## v3.5.0.4

v3.5.0.4 was released on September 26, 2021.

#### Improvements

To improve audio quality when a user uses a Bluetooth headset, this release optimizes the logic for selecting Bluetooth profiles and volume types.

- Bluetooth profile: As of this release, the Bluetooth profile used by the SDK is only affected by the user role.

  - If a user in the communication profile or a host in the interactive live streaming profile uses a Bluetooth headset, the Bluetooth headset captures and plays audio through the Hands-Free Profile (HFP).
  - If an audience member in the interactive live streaming profile uses a Bluetooth headset, the Bluetooth headset plays audio through the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP).

- Volume type: This release regulates the volume type. When a user uses a Bluetooth headset, the SDK uses the following volume type:

  | Audio scenario         | User in the communication profile/Host in the interactive live streaming profile | Audience in the interactive live streaming profile |
  | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
  | `Default`                | In-call volume                                               | Media volume                                       |
  | `ChatRoomGaming`        | In-call volume                                               | In-call volume                                     |
  | `GameStreaming`         | Media volume             | Media volume                                       |
  | `ChatRoomEntertainment` | In-call volume                                               | In-call volume                                     |
  | `Education`              | In-call volume                                               | Media volume                                       |
  | `ShowRoom`               | In-call volume                                               | Media volume                                       |
  | `Meeting`                | Media volume              | Media volume                                       |

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Repeated declaration of the `didAudioMuted`, `didVideoEnabled`, `didLocalVideoEnabled`, and `firstRemoteVideoDecodedOfUid` functions occurred in the header file.
- When you called `setAudioMixingPosition` multiple times to set the playback position of the music file after you called `startAudioMixing` to successfully play music, the music file would most likely be played from the beginning.
- In the `AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoomGaming` audio scenario, the moment a user in the channel switched the role from `AgoraClientRoleAudience` to `AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster`, that user heard a zipping noise.

## v3.5.0.3

v3.5.0.3 was released on September 6, 2021.

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes.
- A naming conflict existed in the `AgoraReachability` class between the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> and Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />.

<a name="v3.5.0.1"></a>

## v3.5.0.1

v3.5.0.1 was released on August 4, 2021. This release fixed the following issue: Due to the strong reference to `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` by `AgoraRtcEngineKit`, the `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` object was released only when `AgoraRtcEngineKit` was destroyed, which caused a memory leak.

## v3.5.0

<div class="alert note">In this release, a memory leak occurs when <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code> strongly references <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code>. If you set the strong reference to <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code> by <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code>, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.5.0.1. For details, see <a href="#v3.5.0.1">v3.5.0.1</a >.</div>

v3.5.0 was released on July 20, 2021.

#### New features

**Raw audio data from multiple channels**

In order to get the audio data from multiple channels in a multi-channel scenario, this release adds the following callbacks in `AgoraAudioFrame.h`:

- `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`
- `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`

After you successfully register the audio frame observer, if you set the return value of `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted` as `YES` and the return value of `getObservedAudioFramePosition` as `AgoraAudioFramePositionBeforeMixing (1 << 3)`, the SDK triggers the `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx` callbacks to send you the audio data of remote users from multiple channels.

#### Improvements

In scenarios where the AGC is enabled, the convergence time for noise reduction is shortened, which reduces noise fluctuations.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- After a remote user called `enableLoopbackRecording`, occasionally the local user heard an echo of their own audio.
- In the meeting scenario, after a remote user enabled local audio capturing in the channel, occasionally the local user heard an echo of the remote user’s audio.
- After calling `muteLocalAudioStream(YES)` to stop publishing a local audio stream, the local user could hear remote users when the local user joined a channel for the first time. After leaving the channel and joining another channel, occasionally the local user could not hear remote users.
- When the local network quality was poor, the downlink network quality rating (`rxQuality`) of remote users reported by the SDK was not accurate.
- The value of `memoryTotalUsageRatio` reported by the [reportRtcStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportRtcStats:) callback was not accurate.

#### API changes

**Added**

- [`isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/isMultipleChannelFrameWanted)
- [`onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx:channelId:uid:)

## v3.4.6

<div class="alert note">In this release, a memory leak occurs when <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code> strongly references <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code>. If you set the strong reference to <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code> by <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code>, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.5.0.1. For details, see <a href="#v3.5.0.1">v3.5.0.1</a >.</div>

v3.4.6 was released on July 15, 2021. This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crash during SDK initialization under certain circumstances.
- The missing `nonnull` and `_Nullable` modifiers in Objective-C header files caused warnings when the project was run.
- When `startAudioMixing` was called and a percent-encoding URL was passed in this method, the SDK failed to play the corresponding online audio file.

## v3.4.5

<div class="alert note">In this release, a memory leak occurs when <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code> strongly references <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code>. If you set the strong reference to <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code> by <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code>, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.5.0.1. For details, see <a href="#v3.5.0.1">v3.5.0.1</a >.</div>

v3.4.5 was released on June 22, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Support for GCM2 encryption**

To further improve the security during real-time audio transmission process, this release adds the following:

- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM2 (7)` and `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM2 (8)` encryption modes in `AgoraEncryptionMode`. The new GCM encryption modes use a more secure KDF (Key Derivation Function) and support setting the key and salt.
- The `encryptionKdfSalt` in `AgoraEncryptionConfig` to add the salt for the `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM2 (7)` and `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM2 (8)` encryption modes.

This release also changes the default encryption mode from `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128XTS (1)` to `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM2 (7)`. If you use the default encryption mode in earlier versions, after upgrading the SDK to v3.4.5, ensure that you call `enableEncryption` and set `AgoraEncryptionMode` to `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128XTS (1)`.

See [Media Stream Encryption](../advanced-features/channel-encryption).

<div class="alert note">Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users such as the Agora recording service.</div>


**2. Audio stream publishing behavior changes**

To flexibly control the publishing state in multiple channels, this release optimizes the `AgoraRtcChannel` class as follows:

- Deprecates the `publish` and `unpublish` methods, and adds `muteLocalAudioStream` instead.
- Adds the `publishLocalAudio` member in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions`. The default value is `YES`. You can set the publishing state when joining a channel. If a user publishes streams in a channel, regardless of whether the user is a host or an audience member, you need to set `publishLocalAudio` to `NO` when the user joins other channels; otherwise, the user fails to join the channel.
- After calling `setClientRole(AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster)`, the local user publishes audio streams by default. You no longer need to call `publish`.

<div class="alert note"><code>publishLocalAudio = NO</code> serves the same function as <code>muteLocalAudioStream(YES)</code>. If you call them together, the one called later takes effect.</div>

The above improvements bring the following changes in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` class:

- `muteLocalAudioStream` of `AgoraRtcEngineKit` do not take effect for channels created by the `AgoraRtcChannel` class, so you need to use the `muteLocalAudioStream` of the `AgoraRtcChannel` class instead.
- When a user joins a channel by using `joinChannelByToken` with the `options` parameter, you can set the publishing state.
- If a user joins a channel by calling `joinChannelByToken` with the `options` parameter, `muteLocalAudioStream` only takes effect when it is called after `joinChannelByToken`.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.5 or later, to avoid affecting your service, Agora recommends modifying the implementation of `muteLocalAudioStream`, `publish`, and `unpublish`.

See [Set the Publishing State](../advanced-features/set-publishing-state) and [Join Multiple Channels](/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/multiple-channel).

**3. Raw audio data**

The raw audio data function enables you to implement custom audio pre- and post-processing functions, such as audio recording and audio mixing. To reduce the development difficulty and support the accurate observation of audio data at a specific node, this release optimizes the raw audio data APIs as follows:

- To align with the raw video data API names, changes the name of `setAudioFrameDelegate` to `setAudioDataFrame`, and the name of `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate` to `AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol`.
- Adds the following callbacks in `AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol` for you to get the raw audio data at different audio transmission stages and in your expected format:
  - `getObservedAudioFramePosition`: Sets the audio observation positions.
  - `getRecordAudioParams`: Sets the audio recording format for the `onRecordFrame` callback.
  - `getPlaybackAudioParams`: Sets the audio playback format for the `onPlaybackFrame` callback.
  - `getMixedAudioParams`: Sets the audio mixing format for the `onMixedFrame` callback.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.5 or later, to avoid affecting your service, ensure that you modify the implementation of `setAudioFrameDelegate` and `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate`.

**4. startAudioMixing changes**

To avoid blocking, this release changes the `startAudioMixing` from a synchronous call to an asynchronous call.

#### Improvements

**1. Media Push**

To be more transparent to users about errors and events in Media Push, this release adds the following codes:

- To `rtmpStreamingChangedToState`: Error code `AgoraRtmpStreamingErrorCodeUnpublishOK (100)`, which reports that the streaming has been stopped normally. After you call `removePublishStreamUrl` to stop streaming, the SDK returns this error code and state code `AgoraRtmpStreamingStateIdle (0)`.
- To `rtmpStreamingEventWithUrl`: Event code `AgoraRtmpStreamingEventUrlAlreadyInUse (2)`, which reports that the streaming URL is already being used for Media Push. If you want to start new streaming, use a new streaming URL.

**2. App running on an M1 Mac**

This release supports running apps that integrate the Agora iOS SDK on a physical M1 Mac. Due to hardware differences between M1 Mac, iPhone, and iPad, the Agora iOS SDK does not support iPhone- and iPad-specific hardware behaviors on an M1 Mac. For example, it does not support switching the audio route to the earpiece and does not support a rear camera.

**3. Music file state**

When you call `startAudioMixing` after `pauseAudioMixing`, this release adds the `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged(AgoraAudioMixingStateStopped, AgoraAudioMixingReasonStoppedByUser)`state, which indicates the music file is stopped, before reporting `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged(AgoraAudioMixingStatePlaying, AgoraAudioMixingReasonStartedByUser)`.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Under poor network conditions, when you called `startAudioMixing` to play an online music file, occasionally the SDK response time was too long and caused a freeze.
- Under poor network conditions, users were occasionally unable to switch roles.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `AgoraRtmpStreamingErrorCodeUnpublishOK (100)` in [`AgoraRtmpStreamingErrorCode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraRtmpStreamingErrorCode.html)

- `publishLocalAudio` in [`AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions.html)
- The following callbacks in [`AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html):
  - [`getObservedAudioFramePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/getObservedAudioFramePosition)
  - [`getRecordAudioParams`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/getRecordAudioParams)
  - [`getMixedAudioParams`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/getMixedAudioParams)
  - [`getPlaybackAudioParams`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/getPlaybackAudioParams)

**Modified**

- `setAudioFrameDelegate` to [`setAudioDataFrame`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setAudioDataFrame:)
- `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate` to [`AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html)
- [`startAudioMixing`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startAudioMixing:loopback:replace:cycle:startPos:)

**Deprecated**

- `publish` and `unpublish` in `AgoraRtcChannel`

## v3.4.4

v3.4.4 was released on June 18, 2021. This release supports iOS 15.

## v3.4.3

v3.4.3 was released on June 16, 2021. This release fixed the following issues:

- The missing `nonnull` and `_Nullable` modifiers in Objective-C header files caused warnings when you run the project.
- The `startAudioMixing` method could not play the MP3 local music files with the `.m4a` filename extension.
- After a user of the SDK v3.0.0+ left a communication channel that had any user of the SDK versions earlier than 3.0.0 and switched the channel profile to live streaming, the user of the SDK v3.0.0+ set user role to host before joining the next channel, but the client role setting did not take effect.
- Under certain circumstances, an audio delay occasionally occurred 10 minutes after a user joined the channel.

## v3.4.2

v3.4.2 was released on May 12, 2021. This release fixed occasional crashes.

## v3.4.1

v3.4.1 was released on April 22, 2021. This release fixed the following issues：

- Crashes occurred in a certain voice conversion scenario.
- `Non-public API usage` error, which occurred only in v3.4.0, when you uploaded your app to the Apple App Store.

## v3.4.0

v3.4.0 was released on April 16, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**Integration changes**

To reduce the app size after integrating the SDK, this release packages some features as extension libraries (with the `Extension` suffix). For details, see [Extension libraries](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/reduce_app_size_rtc). If you do not need to use the related features, you can remove the corresponding extension libraries and recompile the project.

**Behavior changes**

To monitor the reason why the playback state of a music file changes, this release modifies the `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged` callback as follows:

- Replaces the `errorCode` parameter with the `reason` parameter.
- Deprecates `AgoraAudioMixingErrorCode` and replaces it with `AgoraAudioMixingReasonCode` instead. Using `AgoraAudioMixingReasonCode`, you can get the reason for the change of the playback state, such as start, pause, stop or fail.
- Modifies some logic of reporting `AgoraAudioMixingStateCode`. For example, as of this release, when looping music, the SDK triggers the `AgoraAudioMixingStatePlaying` state when each loop is completed or starts.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.0 or later, to avoid affecting your service, Agora recommends that you modify the implementation of `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged`.

#### New features

**1. Virtual metronome**

To meet the needs of online teaching scenarios that would benefit from a metronome, this release adds the following methods:

- `startRhythmPlayer`: Enables the virtual metronome.
- `stopRhythmPlayer`: Disables the virtual metronome.
- `configRhythmPlayer`: Reconfigures the virtual metronome after it is enabled.

**2. Playback progress of audio effect files**

To control the playback progress of audio effect files, this release adds the following methods:

- `playEffect`3: Sets the playback position when starting playback of an audio effect file by using the `startPos` parameter.
- `setEffectPosition`: Sets the playback position after starting playback of an audio effect file.
- `getEffectDuration`: Gets the duration of a local audio effect file.
- `getEffectCurrentPosition`: Gets current playback progress of an audio effect file.

Also, this release deprecates the `playEffect`2 method. You can use `playEffect`3 instead.

#### Improvements

**1. Playback progress of music files**

To control the playback progress of music files, this release deprecates the `startAudioMixing` method and adds a new method with the same name in its place. The new `startAudioMixing` method allows you to set the playback position when starting playback of a music file by using the `startPos` parameter.

**2. AirPlay callback**

This release adds support for reporting `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingAirPlay` in the `didAudioRouteChanged` callback on iOS devices. When you use Apple AirPlay to play audio on an iOS device, the SDK triggers the `didAudioRouteChanged` callback and reports `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingAirPlay`.

**3. Audio recording**

To set the recording configuration during audio recording, this release adds the `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` method and deprecates `startAudioRecording`2. The `config` parameter of the `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` method allows you to set the audio recording quality, content, sample rate, and storage path of the recording file.

This release also adds a new error code: `AgoraErrorCodeAlreadyInRecording(160)`. If you call the `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` method again before the current recording ends, the SDK reports this error code.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed that the `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers` callback returned incorrect volume information after you called `enableSoundPositionIndication(YES)`.

#### API changes

**Added**

- [`startRhythmPlayer`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startRhythmPlayer:sound2:config:)

**Modified**

- [`localAudioMixingStateDidChanged`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localAudioMixingStateDidChanged:reason:)

**Deprecated**

- `startAudioRecording`2
- `playEffect`2
- `startAudioMixing`1
- `AgoraAudioMixingErrorCode`

## v3.3.2

v3.3.2 was released on March 29, 2021. This release fixed the following issues:

- Joining the channel occasionally failed when a user switched back to the app after keeping it in the background for a long time.
- Under certain circumstances, when a remote user was silent for a long time, the local user heard noises from the remote user.

## v3.3.1

v3.3.1 was released on March 4, 2021.

#### New features

**Voice Conversion**

This release adds the `setVoiceConversionPreset` method to set a voice conversion effect (to disguise a user's voice). You can use this method to make a male-sounding voice sound steady or deep, and a female-sounding voice sound gender-neutral or sweet. See [Set the Voice Effect](../advanced-features/voice-changer).

#### Improvements

**1. AES-GCM encryption mode**

For scenarios requiring high security, to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data, and to improve the computational efficiency of data encryption, this release adds the following enumerators in `AgoraEncryptionMode`:

- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.
- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.

<div class="alert note">Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users such as the Agora recording service.</div>

**2. Remote audio statistics**

To monitor quality of experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream, this release adds `mosValue` to `remoteAudioStats`, which reports the quality of the remote audio stream as determined by the Agora real-time audio MOS (Mean Opinion Score) measurement system.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the issue that you could not get the remote user's volume by the  `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers` callback after enabling the sound position indication.

#### API changes

This release adds the following APIs:
- [`setVoiceConversionPreset`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setVoiceConversionPreset:)
- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM` and `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM` in [`AgoraEncryptionMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraEncryptionMode.html) 
- `mosValue` in [`AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html)

## v3.3.0

v3.3.0 was released on January 22, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

To meet Apple's requirements for using a simulator to run a project, this release changes the SDK package as follows:

- The format of all dynamic libraries changes from Framework to XCFramework. A dynamic library in XCFramework format supports running a project on both physical devices and simulators.
- The `ALL_ARCHITECTURE` folder is removed.

This release also adds `AgoraCore.xcframework`, the Agora basic calculation framework.

To integrate the SDK into your project, see [Integrate the SDK](/3.x/video-calling/quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk#integrate-the-sdk).

**2. Changes to subscribing behavior**

This release deprecates `setDefaultMuteAllRemoteAudioStreams` and changes the behavior of `mute`-related methods as follows:

- `mute`-related methods must be called after joining or switching to a channel; otherwise, the method call does not take effect.
- Methods with the prefix `muteAll` are no longer the master switch, and each `mute`-related method independently controls the user's subscribing state. When you call methods with the prefixes `muteAll` and `muteRemote` together, the method that is called later takes effect.
- Methods with the prefix `muteAll` set whether to subscribe to the audio streams of all remote users, including all subsequent users, which means methods with the prefix `muteAll` contain the function of methods with the prefix `setDefaultMute`. Agora recommends not calling methods with the prefixes `muteAll` and `setDefaultMute` together; otherwise, the setting may not take effect.

See details in [Set the Subscribing State](../best-practices/set-subscribing-state).

**3. Changes to voice activity behavior**

In the remote users' `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers` callback, this release changes the value of the `vad` member from always 0 to always 1.

#### New features

**1. Channel media options**

To help developers control media subscription more flexibly, this release adds the `joinChannelByToken`2 and `switchChannelByToken`2 methods to set whether users subscribe to all remote audio streams in a channel when joining and switching channels.

**2. Cloud proxy**

To improve the usability of the Agora Cloud Proxy, this release adds the `setCloudProxy` method to set the cloud proxy and allows you to select a cloud proxy that uses the UDP protocol. For details, see [Cloud Proxy](../basic-features/use-cloud-proxy).

**3. Deep-learning noise reduction**

To eliminate non-stationary noise based on traditional noise reduction, this release adds `enableDeepLearningDenoise` to enable deep-learning noise reduction.

Before enabling deep-learning noise reduction, integrate the `AgoraAIDenoiseExtension.xcframework` dynamic library into your project files.

**4. Singing beautifier**

To beautify the voice and add reverberation effects in a singing scenario, this release adds the `setVoiceBeautifierParameters` method and adds the `AgoraSingingBeautifier` constant to `AgoraVoiceBeautifierPreset`. 

You can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset(AgoraSingingBeautifier)` to beautify the male voice and add the reverberation effect for a voice in a small room. For more settings, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierParameters(AgoraSingingBeautifier, param1, param2)` to beautify male or female voices and add reverberation effects for a voice in a small room, large room, or hall. 

**5. Log files**

To ensure the integrity of log content, this release adds the `logConfig` property to `AgoraRtcEngineConfig`. You can use `logConfig` to set the log files output by the Agora SDK when you initialize `AgoraRtcEngineKit`. See [How can I set the log file?](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/log) for details.

As of v3.3.0, Agora does not recommend using the `setLogFile`, `setLogFileSize`, or `setLogFilter` methods to set the log files.

**6. Data streams**

To support scenarios such as lyrics synchronization and courseware synchronization, this release deprecates the previous `createDataStream` method and replaces it with a new method of the same name. You can use this new method to create a data stream and set whether to synchronize the data stream with the audio stream sent to the Agora channel and whether the received data is ordered.

#### Improvements

**1. Raw audio data**

This release adds raw audio data APIs for the iOS platform. Once you obtain raw audio data through the following APIs, you can pre-process or post-process it for desired playback effects:

- `setAudioFrameDelegate`
- `onRecordAudioFrame`
- `onPlaybackAudioFrame`
- `onMixedAudioFrame`
- `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing`

**2. Remote audio statistics**

To monitor quality of experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream, this release adds `qoeQuality` and `qualityChangedReason` to `AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats`, which report QoE of the local user and the reason for poor QoE, respectively.

#### API changes

- `setLogFile`
- `setLogFileSize`
- `setLogFilter`
- `createDataStream`

## v3.2.1

v3.2.1 was released on December 17, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

- Crashes occurred when using IPv6.
- When Native clients integrated with the Agora Voice SDK interoperated with Web clients, the Web clients continuously reported the `Client.on(disable-local-video)` or `Client.on(mute-video)` callback.

## v3.2.0

v3.2.0 was released on November 30, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

Since v3.2.0, the following files have been added to the SDK package:

- `Agorafdkaac.framework`: The Fraunhofer FDK AAC dynamic library.
- `AgoraSoundTouch.framework`: The SoundTouch dynamic library.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.2.0 or later, refer to the following steps to add the above dynamic libraries when integrating the SDK:

1. Copy the above files to the folder where the `AgoraRtcKit.framework` file is located.
2. Open **Xcode**, go to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** menu, click **+**, then click **Add Other…** to add `Agorafdkaac.framework` and `AgoraSoundTouch.framework`. Ensure the status of these dynamic libraries is **Embed & Sign**.

This release also merges `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework` into `AgoraRtcKit.framework`. After integrating `AgoraRtcKit.framework`, you can use built-in encryption directly.

**2. Cloud proxy**
This release optimizes the Agora cloud proxy architecture. If you are already using cloud proxy, to avoid compatibility issues between the new SDK and the old cloud proxy, please contact support@agora.io before upgrading the SDK. See [Cloud Proxy](../basic-features/use-cloud-proxy).

**3. Security and compliance**

Agora has passed ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO 27018 international certifications, providing safe and reliable real-time interactive cloud services for users worldwide. See [ISO Certificates](../reference/security#iso-certificates).

This release supports transport layer encryption by adding TLS (Transport Layer Security) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) encryption methods.

<div class="alert note">Transport layer encryption affects the following indicators:
<li>Size of the SDK package: For details, see Product Overview.</li>
<li>The rendering time of the first video frame: The rendering time (median) of the first video frame increases by 0 ~ 70 ms compared to that in v3.1.0.</li></div>

#### New features

**Interactive Live Streaming**

This release adds `setClientRole` for setting the latency level of an audience member. You can use this method to switch between Interactive Live Streaming Premium and Interactive Live Streaming Standard as follows:

- Set the latency level as ultra low latency to use Interactive Live Streaming Premium.
- Set the latency level as low latency to use Interactive Live Streaming Standard.

For details, see the [product overview](../introduction/product-overview) of Interactive Live Streaming. 

#### Improvements

**1. Meeting scenario**

To improve the audio experience for multi-person meetings, this release adds `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting(8)` in `setAudioProfile`.

**2. Voice beautifier and audio effects**

To improve the usability of the APIs related to voice beautifier and audio effects, this release deprecates `setLocalVoiceChanger` and `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`, and adds the following methods instead:

- `setVoiceBeautifierPreset`: Compared with `setLocalVoiceChanger`, this method deletes audio effects such as a little boy’s voice and a more spatially resonant voice.
- `setAudioEffectPreset`: Compared with `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`, this method adds audio effects such as the 3D voice, the pitch correction, a little boy’s voice and a more spatially resonant voice.
- `setAudioEffectParameters`: This method sets detailed parameters for a specified audio effect. In this release, the supported audio effects are the 3D voice and pitch correction.

**3. Interactive streaming delay**

This release reduces the latency on the audience's client during an interactive live streaming by about 500 ms.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- The `stopChannelMediaRelay` method did not take effect.
- The SDK mistakenly returned the `AgoraErrorCodeAdmStartRecording(1012)` error.

#### API changes

**Added**

- [`setClientRole`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setClientRole:options:)

- [`setAudioEffectParameters`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setAudioEffectParameters:param1:param2:)
- `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting(8)` in [`AgoraAudioScenario`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioScenario.html)

**Deprecated**

- `setLocalVoiceChanger`
- `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`

## v3.1.2

v3.1.2 was released on September 14, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

To improve user experience, this version disables the local network connection quality report by default, to prevent the prompt to find local network devices from popping up when an end user launches the app on an iOS 14.0 device. The [[gatewayRtt](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt)](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/[[gatewayRtt](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt)) parameter in the [[reportRtcStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportRtcStats:)](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportRtcStats:) callback is disabled by default. Do not use [gatewayRtt](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt) to obtain the round-trip delay between the client and the local router. See the [FAQ](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/local_network_privacy) for details.

If you do not mind the prompt, and want to enable the [gatewayRtt](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt) parameter, please contact Agora technical support via [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

- `AgoraIpAreaCode_INDIA`: India.

**2. Encryption**

This release adds the `enableEncryption` method for enabling built-in encryption, and deprecates the following methods:

- `setEncryptionSecret`
- `setEncryptionMode`

**3. More in-call statistics**

This release adds the following attributes to provide more in-call statistics:

- Adds `txPacketLossRate` in `AgoraRtcLocalAudioStats`, which represents the audio packet loss rate (%) from the local client to the Agora edge server before applying anti-packet loss strategies.
- Adds `publishDuration` in `AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats`, which represents the total publish duration (ms) of the remote media stream.

**4. Audio profile**

To improve audio performance, this release adjusts the maximum audio bitrate of each audio profile as follows:

| Profile                                   | v3.1.0                                                       | Earlier than v3.1.0                                          |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AgoraAudioProfileDefault`                   | <li>For the interactive streaming profile: 64 Kbps</li><li>For the communication profile: 18 Kbps</li> | <li>For the interactive streaming profile: 52 Kbps</li><li>For the communication profile: 18 Kbps</li> |
| `AgoraAudioProfileSpeechStandard`           | 18 Kbps                                                      | 18 Kbps                                                      |
| `AgoraAudioProfileMusicStandard`            | 64 Kbps                                                      | 48 Kbps                                                      |
| `AgoraAudioProfileMusicStandardStereo`     | 80 Kbps                                                      | 56 Kbps                                                      |
| `AgoraAudioProfileMusicHighQuality`        | 96 Kbps                                                      | 128 Kbps                                                     |

**5. Log files**

This release increases the default number of log files that the Agora SDK outputs from 2 to 5, and increases the default size of each log file from 512 KB to 1024 KB. By default, the SDK outputs five log files, `agorasdk.log`, `agorasdk_1.log`, `agorasdk_2.log`, `agorasdk_3.log`, `agorasdk_4.log`. The SDK writes the latest logs in `agorasdk.log`. When `agorasdk.log` is full, the SDK deletes the log file with the earliest modification time among the other four, renames `agorasdk.log` to the name of the deleted log file, and create a new `agorasdk.log` to record the latest logs.

**6. Others**

- This release improves the performance of some iOS models (using Apple A10 and below chips), reducing CPU utilization and memory footprint.
- This release reduces the playback time of the first remote audio frame.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- `setAudioMixingPitch` did not work when setting the `pitch` parameter to certain values.
- Occasional audio freeze when disconnecting from a Bluetooth device.
- The app did not receive the `setMediaMetadataDataSource` callback.
- Occasional crashes when the user left the channel after talking in multiple channels.

#### API changes

**Added**

## v3.0.1

v3.0.1 was released on May 27, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

**Dynamic library**

This release replaces the static library with a dynamic library for the following reasons:

- Improving overall security.
- Avoiding incompatibility issues with other third-party libraries.
- Making it easier to upload the app to the App Store.

To upgrade the <Vg k="VSDK" /> Native SDK, you must re-integrate the dynamic library, `AgoraRtcKit.framework`. This process should take no more than five minutes. See [Migration Guide](migration_apple).

<div class="alert note">Apple supports the dynamic library on iOS 13.4 and later.</div>

#### New features

**1. Audio mixing pitch**

To set the pitch of the local music file during audio mixing, this release adds `setAudioMixingPitch`. You can set the `pitch` parameter to increase or decrease the pitch of the music file. This method sets the pitch of the local music file only. It does not affect the pitch of a human voice.

**2. Voice enhancement**

To improve the audio quality, this release adds the following enumerate elements in `setLocalVoiceChanger` and `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`:

- `AgoraAudioVoiceChanger` adds several elements that have the prefixes `AgoraAudioVoiceBeauty` and `AgoraAudioGeneralBeautyVoice`. The `AgoraAudioVoiceBeauty` elements enhance the local voice, and the `AgoraAudioGeneralBeautyVoice` enumerations add gender-based enhancement effects.
- `AgoraAudioReverbPreset` adds the enumeration `AgoraAudioReverbPresetVirtualStereo` and several enumerations that have the prefix `AgoraAudioReverbPresetFx`. The `AgoraAudioReverbPresetVirtualStereo` enumeration implements reverberation in the virtual stereo, and the `AgoraAudioReverbPresetFx` enumerations implement additional enhanced reverberation effects.

See [Set the Voice Changer and Reverberation Effects](../advanced-features/voice-changer) for more information.

**3. Data post-processing in multiple channels (C++)**

This release adds support for post-processing remote audio data in a multi-channel scenario by adding [`isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/cpp/3.x/classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_audio_frame_observer.html#a4b6bdf2a975588cd49c2da2b6eff5956) and [`onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/cpp/3.x/classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_audio_frame_observer.html#ab0cf02ba307e91086df04cda4355905b) in the `IAudioFrameObserver` class.

After successfully registering the audio observer, if you set the return value of `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted` as `true`, you can get the corresponding audio data from `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`. In a multi-channel scenario, Agora recommends setting the return value as `true`.

#### Improvements

- Improves in-call audio quality. When multiple users speak at the same time, the SDK does not decrease volume of any speaker.
- Reduces overall CPU usage of the device.

#### Fixed issues

- This release fixed issues with inaccurate report of the `didRemoteAudioStateChanged` callback, no audio, audio mixing and audio freezing.
- This release fixed issues that failure to end a call, and inaccurate report of the `didClientRoleChanged` callback.

#### API changes

This release adds the following APIs:

-  [`setAudioMixingPitch`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setAudioMixingPitch:)
- Several elements that have the prefixes `AgoraAudioVoiceBeauty` and `AgoraAudioGeneralBeautyVoice` in the [`AgoraAudioVoiceChanger`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioVoiceChanger.html) enumeration
- `AgoraAudioReverbPresetVirtualStereo` and several elements that have the prefixes `AgoraAudioReverbPresetFx` in the [`AgoraAudioReverbPreset`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioReverbPreset.html) enumeration
- `totalActiveTime` in the [`AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html) class

## v3.0.0.2

v3.0.0.2 was released on Apr 22, 2020.

#### New features

**Specifying the area of connection**

This release adds `sharedEngineWithConfig` for specifying the area of connection when creating an `AgoraRtcEngineKit` instance. This advanced feature applies to scenarios that have regional restrictions. You can choose from areas including Mainland China, North America, Europe, Asia (excluding Mainland China), and global (default).

After specifying the area of connection:

- When the app that integrates the Agora SDK is used within the specified area, it connects to the Agora servers within the specified area under normal circumstances.
- When the app that integrates the Agora SDK is used out of the specified area, it connects to the Agora servers either in the specified area or in the area where the SDK is located.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the occasional failure to connect to a Bluetooth headset.

#### API changes

**Added**

[`sharedEngineWithConfig`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/sharedEngineWithConfig:delegate:)

## v3.0.0

v3.0.0 was released on Mar 4, 2020.

On Mar 24, 2020, we fixed occasional issues relating to no audio, audio mixing, multiple `didClientRoleChanged` callbacks, and SDK crashes.

In this release, Agora improves the user experience under poor network conditions for both the `Communication` and `LiveBroadcasting` profiles through the following measures:

- Adopting a new architecture for the `Communication` profile.
- Upgrading the last-mile network strategy for both the `Communication` and `LiveBroadcasting` profiles,  which enhances the SDK's anti-packet-loss capacity by maximizing the net bitrate when the uplink and downlink bandwidth are insufficient.

To deal with any incompatibility issues caused by the architecture change, Agora uses the fallback mechanism to ensure that users of different versions of the SDKs can communicate with each other: if a user joins the channel from a client using a previous version, all clients using v3.0.0 automatically fall back to the older version. This has the effect that none of the users in the channel can enjoy the improved experience. Therefore we strongly recommend upgrading all your clients to v3.0.0.

We also upgrade the On-Premise Recording SDK to v3.0.0. Ensure that you upgrade your On-Premise Recording SDK to v3.0.0 so that all users can enjoy the improvements brought by the new architecture and network strategy.

#### Compatibility changes

**Renaming the static library and adding support for dynamic library**

To unify the library names across platforms, this release renames the library from `AgoraRtcEngineKit.framework` to `AgoraRtcKit.framework`. If you upgrade your SDK to v3.0.0, you must re-import the `AgoraRtcKit` class. For details, see [Import the class](../quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk#import-the-class) in the Quickstart.

To improve your development experience, this release also adds support for the dynamic library. You can integrate either the static or the dynamic library in your project, and the name of the dynamic library package is Agora_Native_SDK_for_iOS_v3_0_0_VOICE_Dynamic. 

Integrating the dynamic library has the following advantages:

- The overall security level is improved.
- Incompatibility issues with other third-party libraries are avoided.
- Uploading the app onto App Store is easier.

If you prefer the dynamic library, you need to re-integrate the SDK and re-import the `AgoraRtcKit` class. This process should take no more than five minutes. See [Integrate the SDK](../quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk#integrate-the-sdk) and [Import the class](../quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk#import-the-class) in the Quickstart.

<div class="alert info" />The following table shows the difference in the file size when generating ipa files with a dynamic and static library:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="8%"><b>Library type</b></td>
        <td width="15%"><b>ipa size (M)</b></td>
        <td width="10%"><b>Decompressed ipa size (M)</b></td>
        <td width="17%"><b>Frameworks folder size (M)</b></td>
        <td width="15%"><b>Binary file size (M)</b></td>
        <td width="25%"><b>Total size of frameworks folder + binary file (M)</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dynamic library</td>
        <td>27</td>
        <td>56.6</td>
        <td>44</td>
        <td>2.4</td>
        <td>46.4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Static library</td>
        <td>26.5</td>
        <td>55.3</td>
        <td>30.1</td>
        <td>15.1</td>
        <td>45.2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The dynamic library is located in the framework folder as an independent library. Note that the corresponding binary file size does not include the SDK size. Overall, this decreases the binary file size by 12.7 M and increases the framework folder size by 13.9 M.

#### New features

**1. Multiple channel management**

To enable a user to join an unlimited number of channels at a time, this release adds the [`AgoraRtcChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcChannel.html) and [`AgoraRtcChannelDelegate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcChannelDelegate.html) classes. By creating multiple `AgoraRtcChannel` objects, a user can join the corresponding channels at the same time.

After joining multiple channels, users can receive the audio streams of all the channels, but publish one stream to only one channel at a time. This feature applies to scenarios where users need to receive streams from multiple channels, or frequently switch between channels to publish streams. See [Join multiple channels](/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/multiple-channel) for details.

**2. Adjusting the playback volume of the specified remote user**

Adds [`adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume:volume:) for adjusting the playback volume of a specified remote user. You can call this method as many times as necessary in a call or interactive live streaming to adjust the playback volume of different remote users, or to repeatedly adjust the playback volume of the same remote user.

**3. Agora Mediaplayer Kit**

To enrich the playability of the interactive live streaming, Agora releases the Mediaplayer Kit plug-in, which supports the host playing local or online media resources and sharing them with all users in the channel during the interactive streaming. See [Mediaplayer Kit release notes](/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/reference/mpk-release) for details.

#### Improvements

**1. Audio profiles**

To meet the need for higher audio quality, this release adjusts the corresponding audio profile of `AgoraAudioProfileDefault(0)` in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile.

| SDK   | `AgoraAudioProfileDefault(0)`                                  |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| v3.0.0      | A sample rate of 48 KHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 52 Kbps. |
| Earlier than v3.0.0 | A sample rate of 32 KHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 52 Kbps. |


**2. Quality statistics**

Adds the following members in the [`AgoraChannelStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html) class for providing more in-call statistics, making it easier to monitor the call quality and memory usage in real time:

- [gatewayRtt](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt)
- `memoryAppUsageRatio`
- `memoryTotalUsageRatio`
- `memoryAppUsageInKbytes`

**3. Others**

This release enables interoperability between the Native SDK and the Web SDK by default, and deprecates the `enableWebSdkInteroperability` method.

#### Issues fixed

- Audio issues concerning audio mixing, audio encoding, and echo.
- Other issues related to app crashes, log file, and unstable service when pushing streams to the CDN.

#### API changes

**Behavior change**

Calling [`enableLocalAudio (NO)`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableLocalAudio:) does not change the in-call volume to media volume.

**Added**

- The `channelId` parameter in the [`AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo.html) struct
- [`createRtcChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/createRtcChannel:)

- The [gatewayRtt](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/ios/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt), `memoryAppUsageRatio`, `memoryTotalUsageRatio` and `memoryAppUsageInKbytes` members in the [`AgoraChannelStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html) class

**Deprecated**

- `enableWebSdkInteroperability`
- `firstRemoteAudioFrameDecodedOfUid` and `firstRemoteAudioFrameOfUid`. Use the [`remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid:state:reason:elapsed:) callback instead.
- `streamPublishedWithUrl` and `streamUnpublishedWithUrl`. Use the [`rtmpStreamingChangedToState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:rtmpStreamingChangedToState:state:errorCode:) callback instead.

## v2.9.1

<div class="alert note">As of December 8, 2021, Agora begins implementing the retirement process for the Voice SDK and Video SDK for native platforms and third-party frameworks earlier than v3.0.0. See <a href="../introduction/service-sunset-plans">Service Sunset Plans</a>.</div>

v2.9.1 is released on Sep 19, 2019.

#### New features

**Detecting local voice activity**

This release adds the `report_vad(bool)` parameter to the [`enableAudioVolumeIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableAudioVolumeIndication:smooth:report_vad:) method to enable local voice activity detection. Once it is enabled, you can check the [`AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo.html) struct of the [`reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers:totalVolume:) callback for the voice activity status of the local user.

#### Improvements

**Supporting more audio sample rates for recording**

To enable more audio sample rate options for recording, this release adds a new [`startAudioRecording`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startAudioRecording:sampleRate:quality:) method with a `sampleRate` parameter. In the new method, you can set the sample rate as 16, 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz. The original method supports only a fixed sample rate of 32 kHz and is deprecated.

#### Issues fixed

**Audio**

- Audio freezes.
- Abnormal audio when a user rejoins the channel after a third-party app interrupts the call.
- Echoes occur when a user is in a channel.

**Miscellaneous**

- The remote users do not receive the [`didUpdatedUserInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didUpdatedUserInfo:withUid:) callback when the local user switches the network connection before joining the channel and calls the [`joinChannelByUserAccount`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByUserAccount:token:channelId:joinSuccess:) method.
- Mixing streams occur in Media Push.

#### API changes

To improve the user experience, we made the following changes in v2.9.1:

**Added**

- [`startAudioRecording`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startAudioRecording:sampleRate:quality:)
- The `report_vad` parameter in the [`enableAudioVolumeIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableAudioVolumeIndication:smooth:report_vad:) method
- The `vad` member in the [`AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo.html) class

**Deprecated**

- `startAudioRecording`

## v2.9.0
v2.9.0 is released on Aug. 16, 2019.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Media Push**

In this release, we deleted the following methods:

- `configPublisher`

If your app implements Media Push with the methods above, ensure that you upgrade the SDK to the latest version and use the following methods for the same function:

- [`setLiveTranscoding`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLiveTranscoding:)
- [`addPublishStreamUrl`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/addPublishStreamUrl:transcodingEnabled:)
- [`removePublishStreamUrl`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/removePublishStreamUrl:)
- [`rtmpStreamingChangedToState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:rtmpStreamingChangedToState:state:errorCode:)

For how to implement the new methods, see [Media Push](cdn_streaming_apple). 

**2. Disabling/enabling the local audio**

To improve the audio quality in the `Communication` profile, this release sets the system volume to the media volume after you call the `enableLocalAudio`(true) method. Calling `enableLocalAudio`(false) switches the system volume back to the in-call volume.

#### New features

**1. Faster switching to another channel**

This release adds the [`switchChannelByToken`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/switchChannelByToken:channelId:joinSuccess:) method to enable the audience in an interactive streaming channel to quickly switch to another channel. With this method, you can achieve a much faster switch than with the [`leaveChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/leaveChannel:) and [`joinChannelByToken`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByToken:channelId:info:uid:joinSuccess:) methods. After the audience successfully switches to another channel by calling the [`switchChannelByToken`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/switchChannelByToken:channelId:joinSuccess:) method, the SDK triggers the [`didLeaveChannelWithStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didLeaveChannelWithStats:) and [`didJoinChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed:) callbacks to indicate that the audience has left the original channel and joined a new one. 

**2. Channel media stream relay**

This release adds the following methods to relay the media streams of a host from a source channel to a destination channel. This feature applies to scenarios such as online singing contests, where hosts of different interactive streaming channels interact with each other.

- [`startChannelMediaRelay`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startChannelMediaRelay:)
- [`updateChannelMediaRelay`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/updateChannelMediaRelay:)
- [`stopChannelMediaRelay`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/stopChannelMediaRelay)

During the media stream relay, the SDK reports the states and events of the relay with the  [`channelMediaRelayStateDidChange`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:channelMediaRelayStateDidChange:error:) and [`didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent:) callbacks.

For more information on the implementation, API call sequence, sample code, and considerations, see [Co-host Across Channels](media_relay_apple).

**3. Reporting the local and remote audio state**

This release adds the [`localAudioStateChange`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localAudioStateChange:error:) and [`remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid:state:reason:elapsed:) callbacks to report the local and remote audio states. With these callbacks, the SDK reports the following states for the local and remote audio:

- The local audio: Stopped(0), Recording(1), Encoding(2), or Failed(3). When the state is Failed(3), see the `error` parameter for troubleshooting.
- The remote audio: Stopped(0), Starting(1), Decoding(2), Frozen(3), or Failed(4). See the `reason` parameter for why the remote audio state changes.

**4. Reporting the local audio statistics**

This release adds the [`localAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localAudioStats:) callback to report the statistics of the local audio during a call, including the number of channels, the sending sample rate, and the average sending bitrate of the local audio.

**5. Pulling the remote audio data**

To improve the experience in audio playback, this release adds the following methods to pull the remote audio data. After getting the audio data, you can process it and play it with the audio effects that you want.

- [`enableExternalAudioSink`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableExternalAudioSink:channels:)
- [`disableExternalAudioSink`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/disableExternalAudioSink)
- [`pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData:lengthInByte:)
- [`pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte:)

The difference between the `onPlaybackAudioFrame` callback and the `pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData` / `pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte` method is as follows:

- `onPlaybackAudioFrame`: The SDK sends the audio data to the app once every 10 ms. Any delay in processing the audio frames may result in an audio delay.
- `pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData` / `pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte`: The app pulls the remote audio data. After setting the audio data parameters, the SDK adjusts the frame buffer and avoids problems caused by jitter in external audio playback.

#### Improvements

**1. Reporting more statistics of the in-call quality**

This release adds the following statistics in the [`AgoraChannelStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html) class:

- `AgoraChannelStats`: The total number of the sent audio bytes and  received audio bytes during a session.

**2. Other Improvements**

- Improves the audio quality when the audio scenario is set to `GameStreaming`.
- Improves the audio quality after the user disables the microphone in the `Communication` profile.

#### Issues fixed

**Audio**

- When interoperating with a Web app, voice distortion occurs after the native app enables the remote sound position indication.
- Crashes occur when using the Voice SDK.
- Audio freezes when the audience in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile sets the audio session category to playback.
- No audio after a Web app joins the channel when the remote sound position indication is enabled.

**Miscellaneous**

- Occasionally mixed streams in Media Push. 
- Crashes occur after calling the [`leaveChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/leaveChannel:) method.

#### API changes

- [`audioTransportStatsOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:audioTransportStatsOfUid:delay:lost:rxKBitRate:). Use the [`remoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStats:) callback instead.

**Deleted**

- `configPublisher`

## v2.8.0

v2.8.0 is released on Jul. 8, 2019.

#### New features

**1. Supporting string user IDs**

Many apps use string user IDs. This release adds the following methods to enable apps to join an Agora channel directly with string user IDs as user accounts:

- [registerLocalUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/registerLocalUserAccount:appId:)
- [joinChannelByUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByUserAccount:token:channelId:joinSuccess:)

For other methods, Agora uses the integer uid parameter. The Agora Engine maintains a mapping table that contains the user ID and string user account, and you can get the corresponding user account or ID by calling the getUserInfoByUid or getUserInfoByUserAccount method.

To ensure smooth communication, use the same parameter type to identify all users within a channel, that is, all users should use either the integer user ID or the string user account to join a channel. 

**Note**:
- Do not mix parameter types within the same channel. The following Agora SDKs support string user accounts:
	- The Native SDK: v2.8.0 and later.
	- The Web SDK: v2.5.0 and later.

 If you use SDKs that do not support string user accounts, only integer user IDs can be used in the channel.
- If you change your user IDs into string user accounts, ensure that all app clients are upgraded to the latest version.
- If you use string user accounts, ensure that the token generation script on your server is updated to the latest version. If you join the channel with a user account, ensure that you use the same user account or its corresponding integer user ID to generate a token. Call the `getUserInfoByUserAccount` method to get the user ID that corresponds to the user account.

**2. Adding remote audio statistics**

To monitor the audio transmission quality during a call or interactive live streaming, this release adds the `totalFrozenTime` and `frozenRate` members in the [AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html) class, to report the audio freeze time and freeze rate of the remote user.

This release also adds the `numChannels`, `receivedSampleRate`, and `receivedBitrate` members in the [AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html) class.

#### Improvements

This release adds a `AgoraConnectionChangedKeepAliveTimeout(14)` member to the `AgoraConnectionChangedReason` parameter of the [connectionChangedToState](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:connectionChangedToState:reason:) callback. This member indicates a connection state change caused by the timeout of the connection keep-alive between the SDK and Agora's edge server.

#### API changes

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

**Added**

- [registerLocalUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/registerLocalUserAccount:appId:)
- [joinChannelByUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByUserAccount:token:channelId:joinSuccess:)
- [getUserInfoByUid](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/getUserInfoByUid:withError:)
- [getUserInfoByUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/getUserInfoByUserAccount:withError:)
- [didRegisteredLocalUser](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didRegisteredLocalUser:withUid:)
- [didUpdatedUserInfo](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didUpdatedUserInfo:withUid:)
- The `numChannels`, `receivedSampleRate`, `receivedBitrate`, `totalFrozenTime`, and `frozenRate` members in the [AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html) class

**Deprecated**

- The `lowLatency` member in the [AgoraLiveTranscoding](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html) class

## v2.4.1

V2.4.1 is released on Jun 12th, 2019.

#### Compatibility changes

Ensure that you read the following SDK behavior changes if you migrate from an earlier SDK version.

**Publishing streams to the CDN**

To improve the usability of the Media Push service, v2.4.1 defines the following parameter limits:

| Class **/** Interface  | Parameter Limit                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [AgoraLiveTranscoding](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html)        | <li>[videoFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/videoFramerate): Frame rate (fps) of the CDN live output video stream. The value range is [0, 30], and the default value is 15. Agora adjusts all values over 30 to 30.</li><li>[videoBitrate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/videoBitrate): Bitrate (Kbps) of the RTMP live output video stream. The default value is 400. Set this parameter according to the [Video Bitrate Table](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html#//api/name/bitrate). If you set a bitrate beyond the proper range, the SDK automatically adapts it to a value within the range.</li><li>[videoCodecProfile](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/videoCodecProfile): The video codec profile. Set it as **BASELINE**, **MAIN**, or **HIGH** (default). If you set this parameter to other values, Agora adjusts it to the default value of **HIGH**.</li><li>[size](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/size): Pixel of the video. The minimum value of size is **16 x 16**.</li> |
| [AgoraImage](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraImage.html)             | url: The maximum length of this parameter is **1024** bytes. |
| [addPublishStreamUrl](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/addPublishStreamUrl:transcodingEnabled:)     | url: The maximum length of this parameter is **1024** bytes. |
| [removePublishStreamUrl](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/removePublishStreamUrl:) | url: The maximum length of this parameter is **1024** bytes. |

This release also adds the  [audioCodecProfile](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/audioCodecProfile) parameter in the `LiveTranscoding` class to set the audio codec profile type. The default type is LC-AAC, which means the low-complexity audio codec profile.

v2.4.1 also adds five error codes to the error parameter in the [streamPublishedWithUrl](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/removePublishStreamUrl:) method for quick troubleshooting.


#### New features

**1. State of the Media Push**

v2.4.1 adds the [rtmpStreamingChangedToState](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:rtmpStreamingChangedToState:state:errorCode:) callback to indicate the state of the Media Push and help you troubleshoot issues when exceptions occur. In this callback, the SDK returns the `Idle`, `Connecting`, `Runing`, `Recovering`, or `Failure` state. When the state is `Failure`, you can use the error code for troubleshooting. You can still use the `streamPublishedWithUrl` and `streamUnpublishedWithUrl` callbacks, but we do not recommend using them.

**2. More reasons for a network connection state change**

In the onConnectionStateChanged callback, v2.4.1 adds error codes to the reason parameter to help you troubleshoot issues when exceptions occur. The SDK returns the [connectionChangedToState](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:connectionChangedToState:reason:) callback whenever the connection state changes. This release also deprecates `AgoraWarningCodeLookupChannelRejected(105)`, `AgoraErrorCodeTokenExpired(109)`, and `AgoraErrorCodeInvalidToken(110)`.

**3. State of the local network type **

v2.4.1 adds the [networkTypeChangedToType](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:networkTypeChangedToType:) callback to indicate the local network type. In this callback, the SDK returns the `Unknown`, `Disconnected`, `Lan`, `Wifi`, `2G`, `3G`, or `4G` type. When the network connection is interrupted, this callback indicates whether or not the interruption is caused by a network type change or poor network conditions.

**4. Getting the audio mixing volume**

v2.4.1 adds the  [getAudioMixingPlayoutVolume](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume:) and [getAudioMixingPublishVolume](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume:) methods, which respectively gets the audio mixing volume for local playback and remote playback, to help you troubleshoot audio volume related issues.

**5. Reporting when the first remote audio frame is received and decoded**

To get the more accurate time of the first audio frame from a specified remote user, v2.4.1 adds the [firstRemoteAudioFrameDecodedOfUid](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:firstRemoteAudioFrameDecodedOfUid:elapsed:) callback to report to the app that the SDK decodes first remote audio. This callback is triggered in either of the following scenarios:

- The remote user joins the channel and sends the audio stream.
- The remote user stops sending the audio stream and re-sends it after 15 seconds.

The difference between the onFirstRemoteAudioDecoded and `onFirstRemoteAudioFrame` callbacks is that the `onFirstRemoteAudioFram`e callback occurs when the SDK receives the first audio packet. It occurs before the `onFirstRemoteAudioDecoded` callback.


#### Improvements

**1. Playing multiple online audio effect files simultaneously**

v2.4.1 adds the support for playing multiple online audio effect files simultaneously by allowing you to call the [playEffect](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/playEffect:filePath:loopCount:pitch:pan:gain:publish:) method multiple times with the URLs of the online audio effect files.

**2. Reporting more statistics**

- v2.4.1 adds the [txPacketLossRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/txPacketLossRate) and  [rxPacketLossRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/rxPacketLossRate) parameters in the  [AgoraChannelStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html) class. These parameters return the packet loss rate from the local client to the server and vice versa.

- To provide more accurate statistics of the local and remote video, v2.4.1 makes the following changes to the following classes:
  - [AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html): Adds the  [encoderOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/encoderOutputFrameRate) and [rendererOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/rendererOutputFrameRate) parameters
  - [AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html): Adds the [decoderOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html#//api/name/decoderOutputFrameRate) parameter, and renames the receivedFrameRate parameter to the [rendererOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html#//api/name/rendererOutputFrameRate) parameter

**3. Miscellaneous**

- Improved the sound quality of the GameStreaming audio scenario.
- Reduced the audio latency.
- Reduced the SDK package size by 0.5 M.
- Improved the accuracy of the network quality after users change the video bitrate.
- Enabled the audio quality notification callback by default, that is, enabled the [remoteAudioStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStats:) callback without calling the `enableAudioVolumeIndication` method.
- Improved the stability of Media Push.

#### Issues fixed

**Audio**

- The audio stream is interrupted by Siri and does not resume. 

**Miscellaneous**

- Users still receive the `onNetworkQuality` callback after leaving the channel.
- Occasional crashes.

#### API changes

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

**Unified the C++ interface for all platforms**

v2.4.1 unifies the behavior of the C++ interfaces across different platforms so that you can apply the same code logic on different platforms. v2.4.1 implements the methods of the `RtcEngineParameters` class in the `IRtcEngine` class. Refer to [Agora C++ API Reference for All Platforms home page](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/cpp/3.x/index.html) for the applicable platforms and considerations of each interface.

## v2.4.0 and Earlier
**v2.4.0**

v2.4.0 is released on April 1, 2019.

#### Compatibility changes

- Agora Voice SDK for iOS adds a library dependency on `CoreML.framework` in v2.4.0. Ensure that you add this library when integrating the SDK. For details, see [Integrate the SDK](../quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk#integrate-the-sdk).
- If you integrate the SDK by using CocoaPods，ensure that you run `pod update` in your Terminal before `pod install`. If you prefer to specify the SDK version to obtain the latest release, ensure that you specify it as `'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '2.4.0.1'` in the Podfile.

#### New features

##### 1. Voice changer and voice reverberation

Adding voice changer and reverberation effects in an audio chat room brings much more fun. v2.4.0 adds the [`setLocalVoiceChanger`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalVoiceChanger:) and [`setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalVoiceReverbPreset:) methods, allowing you to change your voice or reverberation by choosing from the preset options. See [Voice Changer](../advanced-features/voice-changer).

##### 2. Tracking the sound position of a remote user 

v2.4.0 adds the [`enableSoundPositionIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableSoundPositionIndication:) and [`setRemoteVoicePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteVoicePosition:pan:gain:) methods. Call the [`enableSoundPositionIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableSoundPositionIndication:) method before joining a channel to enable stereo panning for the remote users, and then you can call the [`setRemoteVoicePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteVoicePosition:pan:gain:) method to track the position of a remote user.

##### 3. Pre-call last-mile network probe test

Conducting a last-mile probe test before joining the channel helps the local user to evaluate or predict the uplink network conditions. v2.4.0 adds the [`startLastmileProbeTest`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startLastmileProbeTest:), [`stopLastmileProbeTest`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/stopLastmileProbeTest), and [`lastmileProbeResult`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:lastmileProbeTestResult:) APIs, allowing you to get the uplink and downlink last-mile network statistics, including the bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, and round-trip time (RTT).

##### 4. State of an audio mixing file 

v2.4.0 adds the [`localAudioMixingStateDidChanged`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localAudioMixingStateDidChanged:errorCode:) callback to report any change of the audio-mixing file playback state (playback succeeds or fails) and the corresponding reason. This release also adds the warning code 701, which is triggered if the local audio-mixing file does not exist, or if the SDK does not support the file format or cannot access the music file URL when playing the audio-mixing file.

##### 5. Setting the log file size

The SDK has two log files, each with a default size of 512 KB. In case some customers require more than the default size, v2.4.0 adds the [`setLogFileSize`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLogFileSize:) method for setting the log file size (KB).

#### 6. Cloud proxy

Supports the cloud proxy service. See [Use Cloud Proxy](../basic-features/use-cloud-proxy) for details.

#### Improvements

##### 1. Accuracy of call quality statistics

- v2.4.0 replaces the [`startEchoTest`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startEchoTest:) method with the [`startEchoTestWithInterval`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startEchoTestWithInterval:successBlock:) method. The `intervalInSeconds` parameter of `startEchoTestWithIntervals` allows you to set the interval between when you speak and when the recording plays back.
- v2.4.0 adds three parameters to the [`AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html) class: [`sentTargetBitrate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/sentTargetBitrate) for setting the target bitrate of the current encoder, [`sentTargetFrameRate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/sentTargetFrameRate) for setting the target frame rate, and [`qualityAdaptIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/qualityAdaptIndication) for reporting the quality of the local video since last count.


##### 2. Core quality improvements

- Reduces the audio delay.
- Improves the video quality and stability. 
- Shortens the time to render the first remote video frame. 

#### Issues fixed

##### Audio

- Calling the `enableLocalAudio` method disconnects all connected Bluetooth devices.
- The SDK does not support audio mixing URLs with Chinese characters.
- The SDK does not return YES after the `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` method call succeeds.
- Volume levels of the high-pitch sound are lowered.
- Sounds are occasionally played fast.

##### Miscellaneous

- The user drop-offline time between Android and iOS is not unified.
- The SEI information does not synchronize with the media stream when publishing transcoded streams to the CDN.

#### API changes

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

##### Added

- [`setLocalVoiceChanger`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalVoiceChanger:)
- [`setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalVoiceReverbPreset:)

##### Deprecated

- `startEchoTest`

**v2.3.3**
v2.3.3 is released on January 24, 2019. 

#### Issues fixed

Occasional inaccurate statistics returned in the `networkQuality` callback.

**v2.3.2**

v2.3.2 is released on January 16, 2019. 

#### Compatibility changes

Besides the new features and improvements mentioned below, it is worth noting that v2.3.2:

- Improves the SDK's ability to counter packet loss under unreliable network conditions.
- Improves the communication smoothness.
- Reduces video freezes in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile.

Before upgrading your SDK, ensure that the version is:

- Native SDK v1.11 or later.
- Web SDK v2.1 or later.

#### New features

##### Independent audio mixing volume adjustments for local playback and remote publishing

v2.3.2 adds the [`adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume:) and [`adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume:) methods to complement the [`adjustAudioMixingVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingVolume:) method, allowing you to independently adjust the audio mixing volume for local playback and remote publishing. 

This release also changes the behavior of the [adjustPlaybackSignalVolume](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustPlaybackSignalVolume:) method to control only the voice volume. Therefore, to mute the local audio playback, call both the `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(0)` and `adjustAudioMixingVolume(0)` methods.

See [Adjust the Volume](../basic-features/adjust-volume) for the scenarios and corresponding APIs.

#### Improvements

##### 1. Improves the accuracy of the call quality statistics

v2.3.2 deprecates the `audioQualityOfUid` callback and replaces it with the `remoteAudioStats` callback to improve the accuracy of the call quality statistics. The `remoteAudioStats` callback returns parameters such as the audio frame loss rate, end-to-end audio delay, and jitter buffer delay at the receiver, which are more closely linked to the real user experience. In addition, v2.3.2 optimizes the algorithm of the `networkQuality` callback for the uplink and downlink network qualities.

- [`remoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStats:): Reports the statistics of the remote audio stream from each user/host. This callback replaces the onAudioQuality callback. 
- [`networkQuality`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:networkQuality:txQuality:rxQuality:): Reports the last mile network quality of each user in the channel.

Agora plans to improve the following callback in subsequent versions:

- [`lastmileQuality`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:lastmileQuality:): Reports the last mile network quality of the local user before the user joins a channel.

For the list of API methods related to the call quality statistics and on how and when to use them, see [Report In-call Statistics](../advanced-features/in-call-quality).

##### 2. New network connection policy

v2.3.2 adds the following API method and callback to get the current network connection state and reason for a connection state change:

- [`getConnectionState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/getConnectionState): Gets the connection state of the SDK.
- [`connectionChangedToState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:connectionChangedToState:reason:): Occurs when the connection state of the SDK to the server changes.

v2.3.2 deprecates the [`rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted:) and [`rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned:) callbacks.

In the new API method, the network connection states are "disconnected", "connecting", "connected", "reconnecting", and "failed". The SDK triggers the `connectionChangedToState` callback when the network connection state changes. The SDK also triggers the `rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted` and `rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned` callbacks under certain circumstances, but Agora does not recommend using them.

##### 3. Improves the call rating system

v2.3.2 changes the rating parameter in the [`rate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/rate:rating:description:) method to "1 to 5" to encourage more feedback from end-users on the quality of a call or interactive live streaming. Application developers can use this feedback for future product improvement. Agora strongly recommends integrating this method in your application.

##### 4. Improves the audio quality in music scenarios

v2.3.2 adds high-quality audio in scenarios such as music education. In the [`setAudioProfile`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setAudioProfile:scenario:) method, you can set [`AgoraAudioProfile`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioProfile.html) as MusicHighQuality(4) and [`AgoraAudioScenario`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioScenario.html) as GameStreaming(3) to minimize echo and noise while maintaining the quality of the music.

##### 5. Other improvements

- Improves the stability in pushing streams.
- Optimizes the API calling threads.
- Improves the performance of the SDK on mid-end and low-end iOS devices.
- Checks the headset and Bluetooth device connection.
- Reduces the audio delay.

#### Issues fixed

The following issues are fixed in v2.3.2.

##### Audio

- A user joins an interactive streaming channel with a Bluetooth headset. The audio is not played through the Bluetooth headset when the user leaves the channel and opens another application.
- Crashes when calling the `startAudioMixing` method to play music files.
- A previously disabled microphone becomes enabled when the device connects to a headset. 
- Cannot adjust the volume of the speaker when users change roles, join and leave channels, or a system phone or Siri interrupts.
- Users do not hear any voice for a while when an application switches back from the background. 


#### API changes

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

##### Added

- [`getConnectionState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/getConnectionState)
- [`adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume:)

- [`rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned:)

**v2.3.1**

v2.3.1 is released on September 28, 2018. 

#### New features

##### Disables/Re-enables the Local Audio Function

When a user joins a channel, the audio function is enabled by default.
To receive audio streams without sending any audio streams after joining a channel, this version adds the `enableLocalAudio` method to disable or re-enable the local audio function.
Once the local audio function is disabled or re-enabled, the SDK returns the `didMicrophoneEnabled` callback, and the local audio capturing stops.
This method does not affect receiving or playing the remote audio streams.

The difference between this method and `muteLocalAudioStream` is that `enableLocalAudio` does not capture or send any audio stream, while `muteLocalAudioStream` captures but does not send audio streams.


#### Improvements

- Reduces the CPU consumption in the audio communication profile on some low-end iOS devices.


#### Issues fixed

- Occasional crashes.
- `LiveBroadcasting` profile: Delay at the client due to incorrect statistics.

**v2.3.0**

v2.3.0 is released on August 31, 2018.

#### Compatibility changes

-   An `Accelerate.framework` library is added to the SDK in v2.3.0, which is capable of large-scale mathematical computations and image calculations, optimized for high performance.
-   The security keys are improved and updated in v2.1.0.


#### New features

##### 1. Notifies the user that the token expires in 30 seconds.

The SDK returns the `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire` callback 30 seconds before a token expires to notify the app to renew it. When this callback is received, you need to generate a new token on your server and call the `renewToken` method to pass the newly-generated token to the SDK.

##### 2. Returns user-specific upstream and downstream statistics, including the bitrate, frame rate, packet loss rate, and time delay

The `audioTransportStatsOfUid` callback is added to provide user-specific upstream and downstream statistics, including the bitrate, frame rate, and packet loss rate. During a call or the interactive live streaming, the SDK triggers these callbacks once every two seconds after the local user receives audio/video packets from a remote user. The callbacks include the user ID, audio bitrate at the receiver, packet loss rate, and time delay (ms).

##### 3. Sets the SDK’s control over an audio session

The SDK and app both have control over the audio session. However, the app may restrict the SDK’s control over an audio session and allow another app or a third-party component to control it by using the `setAudioSessionOperationRestriction` method. You can implement different levels of control by choosing the corresponding restriction. You can call this method before or after joining the channel.


#### Improvements

-   Improves the quality for one-on-one voice/video scenarios with optimized latency and smoothness, especially for areas like Southeast Asia, South America, Africa, and the Middle East.
-   Improves the audio encoder efficiency in the interactive live streaming to reduce user traffic while ensuring the call quality.
-   Improves the audio quality during a call or the interactive live streaming using the deep-learning algorithm.


#### Issues fixed

- Excessive increase in the memory usage when multiple delegated hosts in the channel.
- Occasional app crashes on some iOS devices.
- Crashes after publishing streams from some iOS devices.
- Crashes when a user frequently mutes and resumes all sound effects on some iOS devices.
- Excessive increase in the memory usage for the host when the host frequently joins and leaves a channel that has multiple delegated hosts.
- Occasionally, the remote user cannot hear the host when the host switches between `Audience` and `Broadcaster`.
- Occasionally on some iOS devices, a user fails to hear any sound after returning to the channel from a system phone call.
- Occasionally, the audience cannot adjust the channel volume.
- Occasional crashes when a user frequently joins and leaves the channel.
- Occasional crashes when one of the two hosts mutes or disables the local audio while playing the background music.
- Occasional crashes on the iOS device when the device interoperates with the Web and when a web user frequently joins and leaves a channel.
- Occasional crashes on some devices when preloading the sound effects.
- Occasional inter-operational failures between an iOS and a macOS device.
- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices when a user leaves the interactive streaming channel while playing music using a third-party application.
- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices when leaving the channel.
- On iOS, when a host injects a stream to the interactive streaming channel, other hosts can still inject a second stream to the channel.
- Occasional inter-operational failures between SIP devices and the SDK.
- Occasional echo issues when using a specific audio card.
- Failure to adjust the volume on some iOS devices.


#### API changes

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

To avoid adding too many users with the same uid into the CDN publishing channel, the following API methods are added in v2.3.0:

-   `addUser`
-   `removeUser`


The following API methods are deleted and no longer supported in v2.3.0. Agora provides the Recording SDK for better recording services. 

-   <code>startRecordingService</code>

>  If your SDK is upgraded to v2.2 from a previous version, pay attention to the functional changes of this API.

##### 2. Deploy the proxy at the server

We provide a proxy package for enterprise users with corporate firewalls to deploy before accessing our services. 


#### Improvements

##### 1. Audio volume indication

Improves the <code>enableAudioVolumeIndication</code> method. This method once enabled, sends the audio volume indication of the speaker in its callback at set intervals, regardless of whether anyone is speaking in the channel.

##### 2. Network quality detection during a session

To meet the customers’ need for real-time network quality detection in the channel, the <code>onNetworkQuality</code> method improves its data accuracy. 

##### 3. Last mile network quality detection before joining a channel

To test if the customers’ network condition can support audio or video calls before joining the channel, the <code>onLastmileQuality</code> callback changes its detection base from a fixed bitrate to the bitrate set by the customer in <code>videoProfile</code> to improve data accuracy. When the network condition is unknown, the SDK triggers this callback once every 2 seconds. 

##### 4. Audio quality enhancement

Improves the audio quality in scenarios that involve music playback. To achieve high-fidelity music playback, you can set <code>Scenario：AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming = 3</code> in the <code>setAudioProfile</code> method. 

##### 5. Bitcode support

Adds support for Bitcode, which enables App optimization and thinning by the App Store. The package size of the Bitcode SDK is 2.5 times that of the normal one.

#### Issues fixed
