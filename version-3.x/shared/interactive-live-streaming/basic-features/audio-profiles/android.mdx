Apps need to provide different audio experiences according to different business needs. In order to provide these different audio experiences, you can use the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> to set the appropriate audio profile ([`profile`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/android/3.x/enumio_1_1agora_1_1rtc_1_1_constants_1_1_audio_profile.html)) and audio scenario ([`scenario`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/android/3.x/enumio_1_1agora_1_1rtc_1_1_constants_1_1_audio_scenario.html)).

This article describes how to use the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> to set the audio profile and scenario in your app.

## Understand the tech

Audio profiles refer to the combined settings of the audio sample rate, bitrate, encoding mode, and number of channels; audio scenarios refer to the audio processing algorithms recommended by Agora for common business scenarios. For example, for apps in the education scenario, Agora recommends using `AUDIO_SCENARIO_EDUCATION` to obtain a highly smooth and stable audio experience.

The SDK uses the `AUDIO_PROFILE_DEFAULT` profile and the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT` scenario by default. If the default settings cannot meet your requirements, you can call `setAudioProfile` to set the audio profile and scenario before joining a channel.

## Prerequisites

Before setting the audio profile and scenario, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions in your project. See [Start a Video Call](/3.x/video-calling/quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk) or [Start Interactive Live Streaming](/en/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming).

## Implementation

This section describes how to set the audio profile and scenario for common business scenarios. You can add the following sample code to the `/app/java/com.example.<projectname>/MainActivity` file in your project.

### One-to-one online classroom

This scenario mainly requires good call quality with smooth transmission. Agora recommends using the SDK default settings.

```java
mRtcEngine.setAudioProfile(Constants.AUDIO_PROFILE_DEFAULT, Constants.AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT);
```

### Battle royale game

This scenario mainly requires voice clarity, no noise, and a lower bitrate. Agora recommends the following settings:

```java
mRtcEngine.setAudioProfile(Constants.AUDIO_PROFILE_SPEECH_STANDARD, Constants.AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHATROOM_GAMING);
```

### Murder mystery game

This scenario mainly requires high audio performance, with no volume or audio quality change when users mute or unmute the microphone. Agora recommends the following settings:

```java
mRtcEngine.setAudioProfile(Constants.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD, Constants.AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHATROOM_ENTERTAINMENT);
```

### KTV

This scenario mainly requires high-fidelity audio, a high performance to music or singing voice, and support for rich audio effects. Agora recommends the following settings:

```java
mRtcEngine.setAudioProfile(Constants.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY, Constants.AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING);
```

### Podcast

This scenario usually uses professional audio hardware devices and requires high-fidelity audio and stereo audio channels. Agora recommends the following settings:

```java
mRtcEngine.setAudioProfile(Constants.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY_STEREO, Constants.AUDIO_SCENARIO_SHOWROOM);
```

### Music education

This scenario mainly requires high-fidelity audio and support for transmitting the audio effects from the local playback to remote users. Agora recommends the following settings:

```java
mRtcEngine.setAudioProfile(Constants.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD_STEREO, Constants.AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING);
```

### Collaborative teaching

This scenario mainly requires high-fidelity audio, support for rich audio effects, and no volume or audio quality change when users mute or unmute the microphone. Agora recommends the following settings:

```java
mRtcEngine.setAudioProfile(Constants.AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD_STEREO, Constants.AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHATROOM_ENTERTAINMENT);
```

## Reference

This section provides useful references for setting the audio profile and scenario.

#### Sample project

Agora provides an open-source demo project [SetAudioProfile](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/blob/master/Android/APIExample/app/src/main/java/io/agora/api/example/examples/advanced/SetAudioProfile.java) that implements setting the audio profile and scenario on GitHub. You can download the sample project and view the source code.

#### Volume type

The audio scenario affects the volume type. See [What is the difference between the in-call volume and the media volume](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/system_volume).
