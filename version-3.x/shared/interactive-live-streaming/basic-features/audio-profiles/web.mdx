## Introduction

High-fidelity audio is essential for professional audio scenarios, such as for podcasts and singing competitions. For example, podcasts require stereo and high-fidelity audio. High-fidelity audio refers to an audio profile with a sample rate of 48 kHz and a bitrate of 128 Kbps.

## Implementation

BeforeÂ adjusting the audio volume, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions in your project. For details, see [Start a Call](/3.x/video-calling/quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk) or [Start Live Interactive Streaming](/en/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming).

The Agora Web SDK provides the `setAudioProfile` method for developers to set appropriate audio profiles according to the scenarios. The `profile` parameter sets the sampling rate, bitrate, and encoding mode.

### API call sequence

The following diagram shows how to set the audio profile:

### Sample code

```javascript
  // Sets the audio profile with a 48-kHz sampling rate, stereo sound, and 192-Kbps bitrate.
  localStream.setAudioProfile("high_quality_stereo");
  localStream.init(function(){
   // Initialization successful.
  });
```

### API reference

- [setAudioProfile](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/web/3.x/interfaces/agorartc.stream.html#setaudioprofile).

## Considerations

- Call the `setAudioProfile` method before `Stream.init`.
