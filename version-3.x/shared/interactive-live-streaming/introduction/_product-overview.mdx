Agora Interactive Live Streaming Premium and Standard enables one-to-many and many-to-many audio or video live streaming with the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />.

Agora Interactive Live Streaming is different from [Agora Video Call](/3.x/video-calling/introduction/product-overview). In a video call, all users are the same role and can talk to each other freely. In an interactive live streaming, users can be the host or audience, where only the host can talk. For details, see this [FAQ](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/profile_difference).

Different from the traditional CDN live broadcast, which only allows one-way communication from the hosts to the audience, the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> empowers the audience to interact with the hosts by [becoming a host](../reference/glossary#host-becoming), like a viewer jumping onto the stage in the middle of a play to perform.

## Live streaming solution comparison

The following table shows the differences between Agora live streaming products and traditional CDN live streaming:
