This page provides the release notes for the Agora Video SDK for iOS.

## Known issues and limitations

#### Compatibility with iOS 15

As of v3.4.6, the SDK supports iOS 15. For the SDK versions between v3.2.0 and v3.4.5 inclusive, crashes occur on iOS 15. To fix this issue, upgrade the SDK to v3.4.6 or later.

## v3.7.1

v3.7.1 was released on August 4, 2022.

#### Improvements

**1. Super resolution (beta)**

This release deprecates the previous `enableRemoteSuperResolution` method, and adds a method with the same name to support super resolution. If the original resolution of a remote user's video is a × b, the local user's device can render the remote video at a resolution of 2a × 2b after you enable this feature.

Compared to the deprecated method, the new `enableRemoteSuperResolution` method adds a parameter `mode` that can be set as either of following values: 

- `AgoraVideoSRModeManual(0)`: Enables super resolution for the remote user you specify.
- `AgoraVideoSRModeAuto(1)`:  Enables super resolution for the remote user corresponding to the largest rendering window in the channel.

<div class="alert note">
Before using super resolution, ensure that you have integrated the <code>AgoraSuperResolutionExtension.xcframework</code> dynamical library. For other requirements, see the <a href="https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableRemoteSuperResolution:mode:uid:">enableRemoteSuperResolution  documentation</a>.
</div>

**2. Co-hosting across channels**

This release enhances the connection mechanism between the SDK and the server of co-hosting across channels and therefore reduces the failure rate.


#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes occurred.
- The video received by the user appeared to change from dark to bright.
- The local user received the `remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid(2,6)` callback after disconnecting from and reconnecting to a network even though the remote user had not changed the audio state.
- Occasionally, screen sharing ended unexpectedly.
- `gatewayRtt` reported by the `reportRtcStats` callback was inaccurate when the network latency was too high or the router did not respond to ICMP packets.
- Occasional crashes occurred when you called `playEffect` or `startAudioMixing` to play 8-bit PCM-encoded audio in the WAV format.
- The uplink network quality reported by the `networkQuality` callback was inaccurate for the user who was sharing a screen.
- The local audio error reason reported by the `localAudioStateChange` callback after a user denied microphone permission was inaccurate.
- Occasionally, it took users longer than normal to join a channel for the first time.
- When the local user shared audio played by a third-party app using the screen sharing feature, remote users heard echoes.


#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableRemoteSuperResolution`
- `setCameraCaptureRotation`
- `AgoraSRStateReasonInsufficientPerformance(4)` in `AgoraSuperResolutionStateReason`
- `AgoraVBSStateReasonInsufficientPerformance(4)` in `AgoraVirtualBackgroundSourceStateReason`

**Deprecated**

- `enableRemoteSuperResolution`

## v3.7.0.2

v3.7.0.2 was released on June 6, 2022.

This release fixed the issue where native clients saw video freeze on web clients when web clients published H.264 video streams.

## v3.7.0

v3.7.0 was released on April 11, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. JND library integration change**

As of v3.7.0, the JND library is statically compiled in the SDK by default and no longer provided as an extension library. If you have integrated the JND library, remove the JND extension library from your project dependencies and recompile your project when upgrading to v3.7.0. For the description of the JND library, see [extension libraries](../best-practices/reduce-app-size#extension-libraries).

**2. Optimized integration with Swift API**

Swift developers automatically convert the Objective-C API provided by the Agora SDK to the Swift API by using Xcode for integration development. To avoid API semantic confusion due to automatic conversion, this release uses the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro to explicitly define the name of the Swift API for each Objective-C API in the header files.

When you use the Swift API, note that the following Swift API names defined by Agora do not match the Swift API names automatically converted by Xcode:

| Agora Objective-C API                                        | Swift API defined by Agora                                   | Swift API automatically converted by Xcode                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| - (int)updateScreenCaptureParameters:(AgoraScreenCaptureParameters* _Nonnull)captureParams; in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` class | updateScreenCaptureParameters()                              | update()                                                     |
| - (int)setScreenCaptureContentHint:(AgoraVideoContentHint)contentHint; in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` class | setScreenCaptureContentHint()                                | setScreenCapture()                                           |

#### New features

**1. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the feature of spatial audio effect, which can add a sense of space to remote users' audio and simulate the audio transmission process in the real world. This enables the local user to hear remote users with the spatial audio effect.

To use this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**2. Screen sharing**

This release supports screen sharing on this platform and provides the `startScreenCapture`, `stopScreenCapture`, and `updateScreenCapture` methods for this purpose. For the implementation method, See [Share the Screen](../basic-features/screensharing).


**3. Local voice pitch**

This release adds the `enableLocalVoicePitchCallback` method and the `reportLocalVoicePitchFrequency` callback, to allow the SDK to report the voice pitch of the local user at the set time interval to the app.

**4. Reporting the first remote video frame rendered**

This release adds the `firstRemoteVideoFrameOfUid` callback to the `AgoraRtcChannelDelegate` class to report to the local user that the first video frame of the remote user has been rendered in a multichannel scenario. You can also get the remote user ID, the width and height (in pixels) of the video, and the time (in milliseconds) to render the first video frame from this callback.

**5. Reporting the user role switch failure**

This release adds the `didClientRoleChangeFailed` callback to report the reason for a user role switch failure and the current user role in the interactive live streaming.

**6. Reasons for connection state changes**

To help users better understand the cause of connection state changes, this release adds the following enumerators in `AgoraConnectionChangedReason`:

- `AgoraConnectionChangedSameUidLogin(19)`: Join the same channel from different devices using the same user ID.
- `AgoraConnectionChangedTooManyBroadcasters(20)`: The number of hosts in the channel reaches the upper limit. This enumerator is reported only after the support for 128 hosts is enabled.

#### Improvements

**1. Channel capacity improvement**

As of this release, a single channel can support up to 128 concurrent online hosts, who can publish audio and video streams at the same time. The number of audience members in a channel is unlimited. Each host or audience member can subscribe to a maximum of 50 hosts at the same time.

To experience this improvement, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**2. Virtual background**

Test results and user feedback show that the effect of the virtual background feature significantly improves when a user is against a complex background and and adopts a more casual pose. As a result, virtual background is converted from a beta feature to an official feature as of v3.7.0.

**3. A new version of deep-learning noise reduction**

Agora has added the option of using a new version of deep-learning noise reduction to further improve audio quality. To experience this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io)

**4. playEffect improvements**

This release improves the internal implementation logic of `playEffect` to avoid blocking and reduce freezing when playing an audio effect file.

**5. Audio experience optimization**

This release reduces audio stuttering under network conditions with burst jitter and high packet loss.

**6. Transmission upgrade**

This release upgrades transmission protocols and algorithms to enhance the SDK‘s ability to counter poor network conditions. At the same time, this release optimizes the scalable video coding capability for multi-user video scenarios to improve user video experience.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed an issue where the app occasionally failed to rejoin a channel after a user left a channel and put the app in the background for a period of time.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `startScreenCapture`
- `stopScreenCapture`
- `updateScreenCapture`
- `enableLocalVoicePitchCallback`
- `reportLocalVoicePitchFrequency`
- `firstRemoteVideoFrameOfUid` in the `AgoraRtcChannelDelegate` class
- `didClientRoleChangeFailed`
- `AgoraConnectionChangedSameUidLogin(19)` and `AgoraConnectionChangedTooManyBroadcasters(20)` in `AgoraConnectionChangedReason`
- The following constants in `AgoraLocalVideoStreamError`:
  - `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorExtensionCaptureStarted(13)`
  - `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorExtensionCaptureStoped(14)`
  - `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorExtensionCaptureDisconnected(15)`


**Deprecated**

-  Warning code `AgoraWarningCodeSetClientRoleNotAuthorized(119)`, use `AgoraClientRoleChangeFailedReason` instead.


## v3.6.2

v3.6.2 was released on February 22, 2022.


#### New features

**1. Removing extension libraries when using CocoaPods**

Extension libraries are dynamic libraries that can be optionally integrated into a project. As of v3.6.2, when you integrate the iOS SDK with CocoaPods, Agora supports reducing the size of your app after integrating the SDK by using the `subspecs` field in the Podfile to specify the desired dynamic libraries and exclude unnecessary extension libraries. For details about the sample code and the `subspecs` fields, see [Reduce App Size](../best-practices/reduce-app-size).


**2. Video enhancement**

In addition to the image enhancement feature, Agora adds support for more video enhancement features:

- Video noise reduction: This feature reduces video noise and improves video quality. You can use the `setVideoDenoiserOptions` method to enable/disable video noise reduction and set the options of the video noise reduction effect.
- Low-light enhancement: This feature adaptively adjusts the brightness value of the video captured in situations with low or uneven lighting, such as backlit, cloudy, or dark scenes. It restores or highlights the image details and improves the overall visual effect of the video. You can use the `setLowLightEnhanceOptions` method to enable/disable low-light enhancement and set the options of the low-light enhancement effect.
- Color enhancement: This feature intelligently adjusts video characteristics such as saturation and contrast to enhance the video color richness and color reproduction, making the video more vivid. You can use the `setColorEnhanceOptions` method to enable/disable color enhancement and set the options of the color enhancement effect.

<div class="alert note">
<li>Before you use these video enhancement features, ensure that the <code>AgoraVideoProcessExtension.xcframework</code> dynamical library is integrated.</li>
<li>These video enhancement features have certain performance requirements on devices. If your device begins to overheat after you enable video enhancement, modify the video enhancement options to a less performance-consuming level or disable video enhancement.</li>
</div>


#### Improvements

**1. Cloud proxy**

To enrich application scenarios of the Agora Cloud Proxy, this release updates the cloud proxy types (`proxyType`) as follows:

- Changes the meaning of `AgoraNoneProxy(0)` from "Do not use the cloud proxy" to "Automatic mode". In this mode, the SDK attempts a direct connection to SD-RTN™ and automatically switches to TLS 443 if the attempt fails. As of v3.6.2, the SDK has this mode enabled by default.
- Adds `AgoraTcpProxy(2)`, which is the TCP (encrypted) mode. In this mode, the SDK always transmits data over TLS 443.

In addition, this release adds the `didProxyConnected` callback to report the proxy connection state. For example, when a user calls `setCloudProxy` and joins a channel successfully, the SDK triggers this callback to report the user ID, the proxy type connected, and the time elapsed from the user calling `joinChannelByToken` until this callback is triggered.


**2. Audio recording**

This release extends `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` with support for setting recording with dual channels and higher audio quality.

- By adding `recordingChannel` to `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration`, it enables you to set the recorded audio channel to be mono or dual. Because the actual recorded audio channel is related to the captured audio channel and the integration scheme affects the final recorded audio channel, contact technical support for assistance with stereo recording using `startAudioRecordingWithConfig`.
- By adding `AgoraAudioRecordingQualityUltraHigh(3)` to `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration.recordingQuality`, it enables you to set the recorded audio quality to ultra-high. Ultra-high quality is the highest quality available in `recordingQuality`. When you record a 10-minute AAC audio file at a sample rate of 32,000 Hz and ultra-high quality, the file size is approximately 7.5 MB.


**3. Music file playback**

This release optimizes the experience of calling `startAudioMixing` to play music files as follows:

- Reduces issues of audio freezes or no audio when playing music files.
- Increases the accuracy of the audio duration reported by `getAudioFileInfo`.
- Supports more audio file formats. See [Which audio file formats does the Agora RTC SDK support](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/general-product-inquiry/audio_format).


If you want to experience these improvements, ensure that you have integrated the `AgoraFullAudioFormatExtension.xcframework` dynamic library. Given the large size of this library, if you have limitations on app size and do not need these improvements, you can remove this dynamic library when integrating the SDK. For more instructions, see [Reduce App Size](../best-practices/reduce-app-size).


**4. Audio file formats**

This release adds support for playing audio files in the following formats:

- Mono-track online files in MP4 format.
- Multi-track online files in M4A and MP4 formats.

For online MP4 and M4A files, the MOOV atom must be before the MDAT atom.


**5. Audio device errors**

To convey the impact of a system call on the audio sampling, this release adds `AgoraAudioLocalErrorInterrupted(8)` in `AgoraAudioLocalError`, which reports that the audio sampling is interrupted by a system call.


#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Under certain circumstances, local users could see a blurry screen for remote users after switching back to the app from the home screen.
- When playing a specific audio file in the WAV format with the `startAudioMixing` method, there was no sound after a certain period of playback.
- Audio stuttered under high jitter networks.
- Under poor network conditions, you could receive the `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged` callback only after a three-second delay after a successful call to `startAudioMixing`.
- When adding a watermark with the `addVideoWatermark` method, under certain circumstances, the watermark color was different from the original color.
- Occasional crashes.


#### API changes

**Added**

- `setVideoDenoiserOptions`
- `setLowLightEnhanceOptions`
- `setColorEnhanceOptions`
- `enableWirelessAccelerate`
- `wlAccStats`
- `wlAccMessage`
- `enableContentInspect`
- `contentInspectResult`
- `recordingChannel` in `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration`
- `AgoraAudioRecordingQualityUltraHigh(3)` in `AgoraAudioRecordingConfiguration.recordingQuality`
- `didProxyConnected`
- `AgoraTcpProxy(2)` in `AgoraCloudProxyType`
- `AgoraAudioLocalErrorInterrupted(8)` in `AgoraAudioLocalError`


**Modified**

- The behavior of `AgoraNoneProxy(0)` in `AgoraCloudProxyType`.

## v3.6.1.1

v3.6.1.1 was released on January 16, 2022. 

This release fixed the following audio issue:

When an end user muted and unmuted audio from an application using the Agora Web SDK, end users using an application with Native SDK version 3.6.0 might not hear audio from this end user.

## v3.6.1

v3.6.1 was released on January 14, 2022.


#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- After a remote user using a Mac device leaves a channel due to the `leaveChannel` method call, network interruption, or other reasons, the local user sees the remote view stay on the last video frame instead of the remote view directly disappearing as in previous versions.
- Optimizes video rendering methods, which improves compatibility.


#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- The CDN live streaming failed because of the abnormal resolution of the RTMP streaming URL with a port number.
- After you enabled Bitcode settings in Xcode and integrated the `AgoraVideoProcessExtension.xcframework` dynamic library, errors occurred when you uploaded the app to the Apple App Store.
- Occasionally failed to start the camera and video capture due to a system issue that prevented the SDK from getting the device name of the camera.
- Occasional crashes occurred.
- The `startAudioMixing` method call failed to play local iTunes music files starting with `"ipod-library://"`.


## v3.6.0.1

v3.6.0.1 was released on December 10, 2021.

This release fixed the issue that v3.6.0 incorrectly renamed the dynamic library `Agorafdkaac.xcframework` to `AgoraFDKAACExtension.xcframework`.

## v3.6.0

v3.6.0 was released on December 7, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**Media Push**

To reduce the difficulty of integrating Media Push, this release optimizes the API design of Media Push and improves the handling of network issues within Media Push clients and servers. You can experience the optimized Media Push functionality with the following new methods:

- `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscoding`: Starts pushing media streams to a CDN without transcoding. This method works the same as the old method `addPublishStreamUrl(NO)`.
- `startRtmpStreamWithTranscoding`: Starts pushing media streams to a CDN and sets the transcoding configuration. This method works the same as calling the old methods `setLiveTranscoding` and `addPublishStreamUrl(YES)` in sequence.
- `updateRtmpTranscoding`: Updates the transcoding configuration. This method works the same as the non-first call to the old method `setLiveTranscoding`.
- `stopRtmpStream`: Stops pushing media streams to a CDN. This method works the same as the old method `removePublishStreamUrl`.

This release deprecates three old methods for Media Push: `addPublishStreamUrl`, `setLiveTranscoding`, and `removePublishStreamUrl`. Agora recommends that you use the new methods for Media Push and update your code logic by referring to [Media Push](../advanced-features/media-push).

Also, as of this release, whether you use the new or old methods for Media Push, you can experience the following improvements:

- Reporting streaming states, errors, and events:

    - In the `AgoraRtmpStreamingState` state code, adding `AgoraRtmpStreamingStateDisconnecting(5)`: The SDK is disconnecting from the Agora streaming server and CDN. When you call `remove` or `stop` to stop the streaming normally, the SDK reports the streaming state as `Disconnecting`, `Idle` in sequence.
    - Adding the following to the `AgoraRtmpStreamingErrorCode` error code:
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorNotBroadcaster(11)`: The user role is not host, so the user cannot use the Media Push function. Check your application code logic.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorTranscodingNoMixStream(13)`: The `update` or `setLiveTranscoding` method is called to update the transcoding configuration in a scenario where there is streaming without transcoding. Check your application code logic.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorNetDown(14)`: Errors occurred in the host's network.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamPublishErrorInvalidAppId(15)`: Your App ID does not have permission to use the Media Push function. Refer to [Prerequisites](../advanced-features/media-push#prerequisites) to enable the Media Push permission.
    - Adding the following to the `AgoraRtmpStreamingEvent` event code:
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamingEventAdvancedFeatureNotSupport(3)`: The feature is not supported.
        - `AgoraRtmpStreamingEventRequestTooOften(4)`: Reserved.

    <div class="alert note">To ensure the quality of the Media Push, make sure to handle the business logic according to the state code, error code, and event code.</div>

- Adding multiple watermarks and background images during streaming with transcoding: This is achieved by adding `watermarkArray` and `backgroundImageArray` to the `AgoraLiveTranscoding` class.

- Setting the layer number and transparency of each watermark and background image during streaming with transcoding: This is achieved by adding `zOrder` and `alpha` to the `AgoraImage` class.

- Using the HE-AAC v2 audio codec during streaming with transcoding: This is achieved by adding `AgoraAudioCodecProfileHEAACv2` to `AgoraAudioCodecProfileType`.

#### Improvements

**1. Image enhancement**

This release updates the Agora image enhancement algorithm to improve the image enhancement effects that you can enable by calling `setBeautyEffectOptions`. To balance these image enhancement effects, this release changes the default value of `lighteningLevel` from 0.7 to 0.6 and adds `sharpnessLevel` to the `BeautyOptions` structure to support setting the sharpness level.

As of this release, ensure that you have integrated the `AgoraVideoProcessExtension.framework` dynamic library before calling `setBeautyEffectOptions`; otherwise, you cannot experience the optimized image enhancement effects and sharpness adjustment brought out by the updated Agora image enhancement algorithm, but only the image enhancement effects brought out by the older Agora image enhancement algorithm.

**2. Rendering of the first remote video frame**

This release speeds up rendering of the first remote video frame under poor network conditions to enhance user video experience.


#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- When the host in the channel switched their role to `AgoraClientRoleAudience` and then back to `AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster`, the audience heard the host's voice with a voice change effect.
- Occasionally, the video received by remote users froze after you enabled media stream encryption.
- After a user played music with a third-party music player and set the audio scenario to `AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoomGaming`, joining a channel could interrupt the music played by the third-party music player.
- When you were playing an original song, calling `setAudioMixingPitch` to adjust the pitch caused the played song to switch to accompaniment. 
- Remote users could not see the shared screen video during the local user's screen sharing. 
- Remote users saw the screen shared by the local user flicker. 

#### API changes

Changed the default value of [`lighteningLevel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraBeautyOptions.html#//api/name/lighteningLevel)  from 0.7 to 0.6

## v3.5.2

v3.5.2 was released on November 25, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Error codes returned when the request to join a channel is rejected**

To more accurately report the reason for the failure to join a channel, as of this release, the SDK returns the error code `-17(AgoraErrorCodeJoinChannelRejected)` in the return value of the joining channel method in the following situations:

- When a user who has already joined an `AgoraRtcEngineKit` channel calls the joining channel method of the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` class with a valid channel name.
- When a user who has already joined an `AgoraRtcChannel` channel calls the joining channel method of this `AgoraRtcChannel` object.

In the SDK earlier than v3.5.2, when the above errors occur, the SDK might report the error code `17` through the `didOccurError` callback, or return the error code `-5(AgoraErrorCodeRefused)` in the return value of the joining channel method.

**2. Selecting Bluetooth profiles**

To ensure connectivity with Bluetooth headsets, as of this release, when a user in the communication profile or a host in the interactive live streaming profile uses a Bluetooth headset, the SDK checks whether the device supports the Hands-Free Profile (HFP), and selects the Bluetooth profile based on the result as follows:

- On a device that supports HFP, the SDK uses HFP, where the audio is captured and played through the Bluetooth headset.
- On a device that does not support HFP, the SDK changes to the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), where the audio is captured through device's microphone and played through the Bluetooth headset.

#### New features

**1. Audio and video recording on the client**

To enable users to record local audio and video on their client, this release adds the `AgoraMediaRecorder` class, which supports recording the following content:

- The audio captured by the local microphone and encoded in AAC format by the SDK.
- The video captured by the local camera and encoded by the SDK.

The generated recording files are saved in the local path specified by the user.

After successfully initializing the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object, you can call the following methods and callbacks in the `AgoraMediaRecorder` class to implement the local audio and video recording function:

- `sharedMediaRecorderWithRtcEngine`: Creates the `AgoraMediaRecorder` instance.
- `startRecording`: Sets the recording content, duration, format of generated files, and callback interval, and enables the local audio and video recording.
- `stopRecording`: Stops recording the local audio and video.
- `destroy`: Destroys the `AgoraMediaRecorder` instance.
- `stateDidChanged`: Occurs when the recording state changes.
- `informationDidUpdated`: Occurs when the recording information is updated.

<div class="alert note">In the <code>COMMUNICATION</code> channel profile, this function is incompatible with versions of the SDK earlier than v3.0.0.</div>

**2. Video snapshot**

This release adds the `takeSnapshot` method for taking a snapshot of a video stream from the specified user, generating a JPG image, and saving it to the specified path. After a successful method call, the SDK triggers the `snapshotTaken` callback to report whether the snapshot is successfully taken as well as the details of the snapshot taken.

**3. Testing audio and video call loop**

To check whether the local audio device, video device, and network conditions can guarantee the proper sending and receiving of audio and video streams, this release adds the `startEchoTestWithConfig` method. You can call this method before joining a channel to test whether the loop of a user's audio and video devices and network conditions are working properly.

Compared to `startEchoTestWithInterval`, `startEchoTestWithConfig` can test video devices and secure the test, but cannot support setting the time interval for reporting test results.

#### Improvements

**1. Performance improvements**

This release slightly reduces CPU usage in video scenarios by optimizing the FEC (Forward Error Correction) codec.

**2. Experience improvements**

This release improves video sharpness and smoothness under poor network conditions by optimizing the congestion control algorithm.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- The video bitrate failed to climb when a user joined a channel in poor network conditions with high packet loss.
- The video sharpness and smoothness degraded significantly due to a cliff-like drop in video bitrate under certain poor network conditions.
- Remote users heard slightly unsynchronized voice and music when a user called `startAudioMixing` on some Android devices.
- After a local user called `enableDualStreamMode(NO)`, a dual stream (high-quality and low-quality video stream) was nevertheless sent when the user switched from custom video capture using `setVideoSource` with the custom video source in the `Screen` type to SDK capture.

#### API changes

This release adds the following APIs:

- [`startEchoTestWithConfig`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x//Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startEchoTestWithConfig:)
- [`sharedMediaRecorderWithRtcEngine`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x//Classes/AgoraMediaRecorder.html#/api/name/sharedMediaRecorderWithRtcEngine:delegate:)

## v3.5.1

v3.5.1 was released on October 14, 2021.

#### New features

**1. Super resolution (beta)**

To effectively boost the resolution of a remote user's video seen by the local user, this release adds support for the super resolution feature. You can call `enableRemoteSuperResolution` to enable super resolution. The SDK triggers the `superResolutionEnabledOfUid` callback to report whether this feature has been successfully enabled. If it is not enabled successfully, use the `reason` code to troubleshoot issues.

<div class="alert note">Before using super resolution, ensure that you have integrated the relevant dynamical library and that the device performance, number of remote users, and original resolution of remote user's video meet the requirements. For details, see <a href="https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableRemoteSuperResolution:enabled:">the enableRemoteSuperResolution documentation</a >.</div>

**2. Background blurring**

To enrich the virtual background effects, this release adds support for setting background blur when a user enables the virtual background function by calling `enableVirtualBackground`. You need to set the type of the custom background image as `AgoraVirtualBackgroundBlur` and set `blur_degree` according to the degree of blurring that the user desires.

**3. Enabling device flash**

To support calling the C++ APIs to enable the flash of a device on Android and iOS platforms, this release adds the following APIs to C++:

- `isCameraTorchSupported`: Determine whether the device supports enabling the flash.
- `setCameraTorchOn`: Set whether to enable the flash.

**4. Pausing and resuming the media stream relay across channels**

In order to enable the host to quickly pause or resume a cross-channel media stream relay, this release adds the following methods and event code:

- `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay`: Pauses the media stream relay to all destination channels.
- `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`: Resumes the media stream relay to all destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`(12): The SDK successfully pauses relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`(13): The SDK fails to pause relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`(14): The SDK successfully resumes relaying the media stream to destination channels.
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`(15): The SDK fails to resume relaying the media stream to destination channels.

After a successful method call of `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay` or `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`, the SDK triggers the `didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent` callback to report whether the media stream relay is successfully paused or resumed.

**5. Pushing the external audio frame to a specified position**

To meet the different processing requirements of external audio frames in different scenarios, this release deprecates `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [1/2] and `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [1/2], and adds `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [2/2] and `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [2/2] with `sourcePos`instead. You can push the external audio frame to one of three positions: after audio capture, before audio encoding, or before local playback. For example, in the KTV scenario, you can push the singing voice to after audio capture, and push the accompaniment to before audio encoding, so that the singing voice is processed by the SDK audio module, but the accompaniment is not affected by the SDK audio module.

This release also adds `setExternalAudioSourceVolume`, which enables you to set the volume of external audio frames at a specified position.

**6. Advanced settings of the music file**

To set the playback speed, audio track, and channel mode of a music file, this release adds the following methods:

- `setAudioMixingPlaybackSpeed`: Sets the playback speed of the current music file. Agora recommends a value range of [50,400], where 100 represents the original speed.
- `getAudioTrackCount`: Gets the number of audio tracks of the current music file.
- `selectAudioTrack`: Specifies the playback audio track of the current music file. The range of index is [0, getAudioTrackCount()).
- `setAudioMixingDualMonoMode`: Sets the channel mode of the current music file to original mode, left channel mode, right channel mode, or mixed channel mode.

**7. Getting audio file information**

To get the information of any audio file, this release deprecates `getAudioMixingDuration` and adds `getAudioFileInfo` instead. After joining a channel, you can call `getAudioFileInfo`and get information such as duration for the specified audio file in `didRequestAudioFileInfo`.

#### Improvements

**1. Identification and quality testing for 5G mobile networks**

This release adds identification and connection quality testing for 5G mobile networks:

- Adds `AgoraNetworkTypeMobile5G (6)` to `AgoraNetworkType`. When the local network changes to 5G, the SDK triggers the `networkTypeChangedToType` callback to report this network connection type.
- Supports calling `enableLastmileTest` or `startLastmileProbeTest` to test the connection quality of the 5G mobile network.

**2. Other improvements**

This release also provides the following improvements:

- Adds continuous optimization of the portrait edge effect of the virtual background.
- After enabling deep-learning noise reduction, the audio experience is improved when using some Bluetooth headsets.

#### Fixed issues

This release has fixed the following issues:

- In the `AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming` scenario, occasional echo or noise that was caused by inaccurate music detection occurred.
- The local user occasionally saw the remote user with a short black screen after the remote user called `enableLocalVideo(NO)`, `enableLocalVideo(YES)` to disable and enable local video capture or called `muteLocalVideoStream(YES)`, `muteLocalVideoStream(NO)` to stop and resume sending local video in sequence within a few seconds. 
- When `pauseAudioMixing` was called before playing an audio file, and then `startAudioMixing` was called to play the audio file, playback failed.
- When the local user called `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams` and received `onRemoteAudioStateChanged (AgoraAudioRemoteReasonLocalMuted)`, `onRemoteAudioStateChanged (AgoraAudioRemoteReasonRemoteMuted)` was incorrectly received after 15 seconds.
- Crashes occasionally occurred in audio scenarios.
- On some low-end iOS devices, after switching to the background during screen sharing, the app was forcibly closed by the system because it took up more memory than the limit.
- The local user occasionally could not hear remote users after calling `setAudioSessionOperationRestriction`.
- As of v3.4.5, the return value was inaccurate when you called `joinChannelByToken` multiple times in a row.
- When the host used a specific low-end device under certain circumstances, the audience watching the host's video occasionally experience lag.
- Under certain circumstances, when the sender used certain Xiaomi or Redmi devices, the receiver occasionally saw a mosaic square on the received video. 
- When the sender used certain Android emulators, the local video or the video received by the receiver was abnormal. 
- The method call of `enableExternalAudioSourceWithSampleRate` before joining the channel did not take effect. 
- The SDK additionally triggered the `localAudioStateChange` callback to report `AgoraAudioLocalStateRecording(1)` when you called `enableLocalAudio(NO)` after joining a channel.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableRemoteSuperResolution`
- `superResolutionEnabledOfUid`
- `blur_degree` and `AgoraBlurDegree` in `AgoraVirtualBackgroundSource`
- `AgoraVirtualBackgroundBlur` in the `AgoraVirtualBackgroundSourceType`
- `isCameraTorchSupported` (C++)
- `setCameraTorchOn` (C++)
- `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay`
- `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`
- The following enumerators in `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEvent`:
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventPauseSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelSuccess`
  - `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventResumeSendPacketToDestChannelFailed`
- `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [2/2]
- `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [2/2]
- `setExternalAudioSourceVolume`
- `setAudioMixingPlaybackSpeed`
- `getAudioTrackCount`
- `selectAudioTrack`
- `setAudioMixingDualMonoMode`
- `getAudioFileInfo`
- `didRequestAudioFileInfo`
- `AgoraNetworkTypeMobile5G` in `AgoraNetworkType`

**Deprecated**

- `pushExternalAudioFrameRawData` [1/2]
- `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` [1/2]
- `getAudioMixingDuration`

## v3.5.0.4

v3.5.0.4 was released on September 26, 2021.

#### Improvements

To improve audio quality when a user uses a Bluetooth headset, this release optimizes the logic for selecting Bluetooth profiles and volume types.

- Bluetooth profile: As of this release, the Bluetooth profile used by the SDK is only affected by the user role.

  - If a user in the communication profile or a host in the interactive live streaming profile uses a Bluetooth headset, the Bluetooth headset captures and plays audio through the Hands-Free Profile (HFP).
  - If an audience member in the interactive live streaming profile uses a Bluetooth headset, the Bluetooth headset plays audio through the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP).

- Volume type: This release regulates the volume type. When a user uses a Bluetooth headset, the SDK uses the following volume type:

  | Audio scenario         | User in the communication profile/Host in the interactive live streaming profile | Audience in the interactive live streaming profile |
  | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
  | `Default`                | In-call volume                                               | Media volume                                       |
  | `ChatRoomGaming`        | In-call volume                                               | In-call volume                                     |
  | `GameStreaming`         | Media volume             | Media volume                                       |
  | `ChatRoomEntertainment` | In-call volume                                               | In-call volume                                     |
  | `Education`              | In-call volume                                               | Media volume                                       |
  | `ShowRoom`               | In-call volume                                               | Media volume                                       |
  | `Meeting`                | Media volume              | Media volume                                       |

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- On some devices, when you captured video at 353 × 288 resolution using the front camera, the captured video was stretched and distorted.
- When you used raw video data, the SDK incorrectly triggered the `onRenderVideoFrame` and `onRenderVideoFrameEx` callbacks when capturing a local video frame to be rendered.
- Occasional crashes occurred when you used raw video data.
- Repeated declaration of the `didAudioMuted`, `didVideoEnabled`, `didLocalVideoEnabled`, and `firstRemoteVideoDecodedOfUid` functions occurred in the header file.
- After you successfully registered the raw video data observer, the app implemented time-consuming tasks in the `onCaptureVideoFrame` callback and caused video freezes for remote users.
- When you called `setAudioMixingPosition` multiple times to set the playback position of the music file after you called `startAudioMixing` to successfully play music, the music file would most likely be played from the beginning.
- Enabling video mirror mode occasionally caused crashes.
- After you successfully registered the raw video data observer and set the return value of `getObservedFramePosition` as `AgoraVideoFramePositionPreEncoder (1 << 2)`, the SDK incorrectly triggered a `onCaptureVideoFrame` callback that did not match the set observation position.
- In the `AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoomGaming` audio scenario, the moment a user in the channel switched the role from `AgoraClientRoleAudience` to `AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster`, that user heard a zipping noise.

## v3.5.0.3

v3.5.0.3 was released on September 6, 2021.

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes.
- A naming conflict existed in the `AgoraReachability` class between the Agora RTC SDK and Agora RTM SDK.
- When `orientationMode` was set as `FixedPortrait`, the width and height of the video resolution was reversed, which caused the human face in video to be scaled up.

<a name="v3.5.0.2"></a>

## v3.5.0.2

v3.5.0.2 was released on August 11, 2021.

This release fixed black screen issues that occurred when `setupLocalVideo` or `setupRemoteVideo` was called under certain circumstances, such as the following:

- `setupLocalVideo(nil)` or `setupRemoteVideo(nil)` was called to disable the local or remote video view, and then `setupLocalVideo` or `setupRemoteVideo` was called to initialize the local or remote video view.
- `setupRemoteVideo` was called in the `remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid` callback to initialize the remote video view.

## v3.5.0.1

v3.5.0.1 was released on August 4, 2021.

This release fixed the following issues:

- Due to the strong reference to `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` by `AgoraRtcEngineKit`, the `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` object was released only when `AgoraRtcEngineKit` was destroyed, which caused a memory leak.
- The user could not receive the `onRenderVideoFrame` callback from the registered raw video data observer when the `setupLocalVideo` and `setupRemoteVideo` methods were not called. 

## v3.5.0

<div class="alert note">In this release, a memory leak occurs when <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code> strongly references <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code>. If you set the strong reference to <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code> by <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code>, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.5.0.2. For details, see <a href="#v3.5.0.2">v3.5.0.2</a >.</div>

v3.5.0 was released on July 20, 2021.

#### New features

**1. Virtual background (beta)**

This release adds the `enableVirtualBackground` method, with which you can enable and set a virtual background for users as either a solid color or an image in PNG or JPG format. You can use the `virtualBackgroundSourceEnabled` callback to learn whether the virtual background is successfully enabled or the reason for an error.

<div class="alert note">Before you use virtual backgrounds, ensure that the relevant dynamic library is integrated and that the device performance and user scenarios meet the requirements. See the <a href="https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableVirtualBackground:backData:">enableVirtualBackground</a > documentation.</div>

**2. Raw audio data from multiple channels**

In order to get the audio data from multiple channels in a multi-channel scenario, this release adds the following callbacks in `AgoraAudioFrame.h`:

- `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`
- `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`

After you successfully register the audio frame observer, if you set the return value of `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted` as `YES` and the return value of `getObservedAudioFramePosition` as `AgoraAudioFramePositionBeforeMixing (1 << 3)`, the SDK triggers the `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx` callbacks to send you the audio data of remote users from multiple channels.

#### Improvements

**1. Video quality**

The following improvements have been made to the quality of captured and received video in this release:

- Automatically enable the best video-capture strategy to optimize the quality of captured video (including resolution, frame rate, and color range). This improvement only applies to certain video with a capture resolution no higher than 1080P.
- Enable camera autofocus by default, and dynamically adjust the capture behavior to moderate overexposure. If you want to disable autofocus, call `setCameraAutoFocusFaceModeEnabled(NO)`.
- Enhance the video contrast of captured and received video by adapting the [color range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr) to moderate the video whiteness.
- Enhance the color richness of captured and received video by adapting the [color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space) to further restore video colors.

**2. Additional improvements**

This release also improves the following:

- In scenarios where the AGC is enabled, the convergence time for noise reduction is shortened, which reduces noise fluctuations.
- The smoothness of output frames in the custom video rendering scenario is improved.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- After a remote user called `enableLoopbackRecording`, occasionally the local user heard an echo of their own audio.
- In the meeting scenario, after a remote user enabled local audio capturing in the channel, occasionally the local user heard an echo of the remote user’s audio.
- After calling `muteLocalAudioStream(YES)` to stop publishing a local audio stream, the local user could hear remote users when the local user joined a channel for the first time. After leaving the channel and joining another channel, occasionally the local user could not hear remote users.
- When the local network quality was poor, the downlink network quality rating (`rxQuality`) of remote users reported by the SDK was not accurate.
- The value of `memoryTotalUsageRatio` reported by the `reportRtcStats` callback was not accurate.

#### API changes

**Added**

- [`enableVirtualBackground`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableVirtualBackground:backData:)
- [`virtualBackgroundSourceEnabled`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:virtualBackgroundSourceEnabled:reason:)
- [`isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/isMultipleChannelFrameWanted)
- [`onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol.html#//api/name/onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx:channelId:uid:)


## v3.4.6

<div class="alert note">In this release, a memory leak occurs when <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code> strongly references <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code>. If you set the strong reference to <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code> by <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code>, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.5.0.2. For details, see <a href="#v3.5.0.2">v3.5.0.2</a >.</div>

v3.4.6 was released on July 15, 2021.

#### Improvements

To improve the accuracy of face detection results, as of this release, the SDK triggers the `facePositionDidChangeWidth` callback immediately after detecting the disappearance of the human face.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crash during SDK initialization under certain circumstances.
- The missing `nonnull` and `_Nullable` modifiers in Objective-C header files caused warnings when the project was run.
- When `startAudioMixing` was called and a percent-encoding URL was passed in this method, the SDK failed to play the corresponding online audio file.

## v3.4.5

<div class="alert note">In this release, a memory leak occurs when <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code> strongly references <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code>. If you set the strong reference to <code>AgoraRtcEngineDelegate</code> by <code>AgoraRtcEngineKit</code>, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.5.0.2. For details, see <a href="#v3.5.0.2">v3.5.0.2</a >.</div>

v3.4.5 was released on June 22, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Support for GCM2 encryption**

To further improve the security during real-time audio and video transmission process, this release adds the following:

- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM2 (7)` and `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM2 (8)` encryption modes in `AgoraEncryptionMode`. The new GCM encryption modes use a more secure KDF (Key Derivation Function) and support setting the key and salt.
- The `encryptionKdfSalt` in `AgoraEncryptionConfig` to add the salt for the `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM2 (7)` and `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM2 (8)` encryption modes.

This release also changes the default encryption mode from `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128XTS (1)` to `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM2 (7)`. If you use the default encryption mode in earlier versions, after upgrading the SDK to v3.4.5, ensure that you call `enableEncryption` and set `AgoraEncryptionMode` to `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128XTS (1)`.

See [Media Stream Encryption](../advanced-features/channel-encryption).

<div class="alert note">Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users such as the Agora recording service.</div>


**2. Media stream publishing behavior changes**

To flexibly control the publishing state in multiple channels, this release optimizes the `AgoraRtcChannel` class as follows:

- Deprecates the `publish` and `unpublish` methods, and adds `muteLocalAudioStream` and `muteLocalVideoStream` instead. You can set the publishing state of the audio stream and video stream separately.
- Adds the `publishLocalAudio` and `publishLocalVideo` members in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions`. The default value is `YES`. You can set the publishing state when joining a channel. If a user publishes streams in a channel, regardless of whether the user is a host or an audience member, you need to set `publishLocalAudio` and `publishLocalVideo` to `NO` when the user joins other channels; otherwise, the user fails to join the channel.
- After calling `setClientRole(AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster)`, the local user publishes audio and video streams by default. You no longer need to call `publish`.

<div class="alert note">The following APIs have the same function. If you call them together, the one called later takes effect.<ul><li><code>publishLocalAudio = NO</code> serves the same function as <code>muteLocalAudioStream(YES)</code>.</li>
<li><code>publishLocalVideo = NO</code> serves the same function as <code>muteLocalVideoStream(YES)</code>.</li></ul></div>

The above improvements bring the following changes in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` class:

- `muteLocalAudioStream` and `muteLocalVideoStream` of `AgoraRtcEngineKit` do not take effect for channels created by the `AgoraRtcChannel` class, so you need to use the `muteLocalAudioStream` and `muteLocalVideoStream` of the `AgoraRtcChannel` class instead.
- When a user joins a channel by using `joinChannelByToken` with the `options` parameter, you can set the publishing state.
- If a user joins a channel by calling `joinChannelByToken` with the `options` parameter, `muteLocalAudioStream` or `muteLocalVideoStream` only takes effect when it is called after `joinChannelByToken`.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.5 or later, to avoid affecting your service, Agora recommends modifying the implementation of `muteLocalAudioStream`, `muteLocalVideoStream`, `publish`, and `unpublish`.

See [Set the Publishing State](../advanced-features/set-publishing-state) and [Join Multiple Channels](../../../interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/multiple-channel).

**3. Raw audio data**

The raw audio data function enables you to implement custom audio pre- and post-processing functions, such as audio recording and audio mixing. To reduce the development difficulty and support the accurate observation of audio data at a specific node, this release optimizes the raw audio data APIs as follows:

- To align with the raw video data API names, changes the name of `setAudioFrameDelegate` to `setAudioDataFrame`, and the name of `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate` to `AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol`.
- Adds the following callbacks in `AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol` for you to get the raw audio data at different audio transmission stages and in your expected format:
  - `getObservedAudioFramePosition`: Sets the audio observation positions.
  - `getRecordAudioParams`: Sets the audio recording format for the `onRecordFrame` callback.
  - `getPlaybackAudioParams`: Sets the audio playback format for the `onPlaybackFrame` callback.
  - `getMixedAudioParams`: Sets the audio mixing format for the `onMixedFrame` callback.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.5 or later, to avoid affecting your service, ensure that you modify the implementation of `setAudioFrameDelegate` and `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate`.

**4. startAudioMixing changes**

To avoid blocking, this release changes the `startAudioMixing` from a synchronous call to an asynchronous call.

#### New features

**Raw video data and local encoded video data**

To reduce system-resource consumption on devices and the development difficulty of using C++ APIs across platforms, this release adds the following APIs to the Android/iOS platform for you to implement a raw video data observer and a local encoded video data observer. You can use them to implement custom functions, such as recording video, taking screenshots, and image enhancement.

- Raw video data observer:

  - `setVideoDataFrame`: Registers a raw video data observer.
  - `onCaptureVideoFrame`: Gets the video data captured by the local camera.
  - `onPreEncodedVideoFrame`: Gets the local pre-encoded video data.
  - `onRenderVideoFrame`: Gets the incoming remote video data.
  - `getVideoFormatPreference`: Sets the format of the raw video data output by the SDK.
  - `getRotationApplied`: Sets whether to rotate the raw video data output by the SDK.
  - `getMirrorApplied`: Sets whether to mirror the raw video data output by the SDK.
  - `getObservedFramePosition`: Sets the video observation position.
  - `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`: Sets whether the SDK outputs remote video data received in multiple channels.
  - `onRenderVideoFrameEx`: Gets the remote video data received in multiple channels.

- Local encoded video data observer:

  - `setVideoEncodedFrame`: Registers a local encoded video data observer.
  - `onVideoEncodedFrame`: Gets the local encoded video data.

#### Improvements

**1. Media Push**

To be more transparent to users about errors and events in Media Push, this release adds the following codes:

- To `rtmpStreamingChangedToState`: Error code `AgoraRtmpStreamingErrorCodeUnpublishOK (100)`, which reports that the streaming has been stopped normally. After you call `removePublishStreamUrl` to stop streaming, the SDK returns this error code and state code `AgoraRtmpStreamingStateIdle (0)`.
- To `rtmpStreamingEventWithUrl`: Event code `AgoraRtmpStreamingEventUrlAlreadyInUse (2)`, which reports that the streaming URL is already being used for Media Push. If you want to start new streaming, use a new streaming URL.

**2. App running on an M1 Mac**

This release supports running apps that integrate the Agora iOS SDK on a physical M1 Mac. Due to hardware differences between M1 Mac, iPhone, and iPad, the Agora iOS SDK does not support iPhone- and iPad-specific hardware behaviors on an M1 Mac. For example, it does not support switching the audio route to the earpiece and does not support a rear camera.

**3. Music file state**

When you call `startAudioMixing` after `pauseAudioMixing`, this release adds the `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged(AgoraAudioMixingStateStopped, AgoraAudioMixingReasonStoppedByUser)`state, which indicates the music file is stopped, before reporting `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged(AgoraAudioMixingStatePlaying, AgoraAudioMixingReasonStartedByUser)`.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Under poor network conditions, when you called `startAudioMixing` to play an online music file, occasionally the SDK response time was too long and caused a freeze.
- Under poor network conditions, users were occasionally unable to switch roles.
- Occasionally, the user's view was upside down when the application was running on an M1 chip device.

#### API changes

## v3.4.4

v3.4.4 was released on June 18, 2021. This release supports iOS 15.

## v3.4.3

v3.4.3 was released on June 16, 2021. This release fixed the following issues:

- The missing `nonnull` and `_Nullable` modifiers in Objective-C header files caused warnings when you run the project.
- The `startAudioMixing` method could not play the MP3 local music files with the `.m4a` filename extension.
- After a user of the SDK v3.0.0+ left a communication channel that had any user of the SDK versions earlier than 3.0.0 and switched the channel profile to live streaming, the user of the SDK v3.0.0+ set user role to host before joining the next channel, but the client role setting did not take effect.
- Under certain circumstances, an audio delay occasionally occurred 10 minutes after a user joined the channel.

<a name="v3.4.2"></a>
## v3.4.2

v3.4.2 was released on May 12, 2021. This release fixed the following issues:
- Interoperability issues between v3.4.0 or v3.4.1 and versions earlier than v3.0.0:
  - With the `Communication` channel profile, users of the v3.4.0 or v3.4.1 Native SDK experienced video freezes if they subscribed to videos from users of the Native SDK with versions earlier than v3.0.0.
  - With the `LiveBroadcasting` channel profile, users of the v3.4.0 or v3.4.1 Native SDK experienced video freezes if they subscribed to videos from users of the Windows or macOS SDK with versions earlier than v3.0.0.
- Occasional crashes.

## v3.4.1

<div class="alert note">When the v3.4.0 or v3.4.1 SDK interoperates with the SDK earlier than v3.0.0, video freezes may occur. To interoperate with SDKs earlier than v3.0.0, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.2. For details, see <a href="#v3.4.2">v3.4.2</a >.</div>


v3.4.1 was released on April 22, 2021. This release fixed the following issues：

- Crashes occurred in a certain voice conversion scenario.
- `Non-public API usage` error, which occurred only in v3.4.0, when you uploaded your app to the Apple App Store.
- Under extremely poor network conditions, the host's video sent from the Web clients was corrupted on the Native clients.

## v3.4.0

<div class="alert note">When the v3.4.0 or v3.4.1 SDK interoperates with the SDK earlier than v3.0.0, video freezes may occur. To interoperate with SDKs earlier than v3.0.0, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.2. For details, see <a href="#v3.4.2">v3.4.2</a >.</div>

v3.4.0 was released on April 16, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**Integration changes**

To reduce the app size after integrating the SDK, this release packages some features as extension libraries (with the `Extension` suffix). For details, see [Extension libraries](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/reduce_app_size_rtc). If you do not need to use the related features, you can remove the corresponding extension libraries and recompile the project.

**Behavior changes**

To monitor the reason why the playback state of a music file changes, this release modifies the `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged` callback as follows:

- Replaces the `errorCode` parameter with the `reason` parameter.
- Deprecates `AgoraAudioMixingErrorCode` and replaces it with `AgoraAudioMixingReasonCode` instead. Using `AgoraAudioMixingReasonCode`, you can get the reason for the change of the playback state, such as start, pause, stop or fail.
- Modifies some logic of reporting `AgoraAudioMixingStateCode`. For example, as of this release, when looping music, the SDK triggers the `AgoraAudioMixingStatePlaying` state when each loop is completed or starts.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.4.0 or later, to avoid affecting your service, Agora recommends that you modify the implementation of `localAudioMixingStateDidChanged`.

#### New features

**1. Virtual metronome**

To meet the needs of online teaching scenarios that would benefit from a metronome, this release adds the following methods:

- `startRhythmPlayer`: Enables the virtual metronome.
- `stopRhythmPlayer`: Disables the virtual metronome.
- `configRhythmPlayer`: Reconfigures the virtual metronome after it is enabled.

**2. Playback progress of audio effect files**

To control the playback progress of audio effect files, this release adds the following methods:

- `playEffect`3: Sets the playback position when starting playback of an audio effect file by using the `startPos` parameter.
- `setEffectPosition`: Sets the playback position after starting playback of an audio effect file.
- `getEffectDuration`: Gets the duration of a local audio effect file.
- `getEffectCurrentPosition`: Gets current playback progress of an audio effect file.

Also, this release deprecates the `playEffect`2 method. You can use `playEffect`3 instead.

#### Improvements

**1. Video encoding**

The Agora SDK allows you to use `degradationPreference` to set the degradation preference of local video encoding under limited bandwidth, for example, reducing the video frame rate while maintaining video quality, or reducing the video quality while maintaining the video frame rate. As of this release, `degradationPreference` can be set as `AgoraDegradationBalanced`, which reduces the video frame rate and video quality simultaneously to strike a balance between smoothness and video quality. `AgoraDegradationBalanced` is suitable for scenarios where both smoothness and video quality are a priority, such as one-to-one calls, one-to-one online teaching, and multi-user online meetings.

**2. Raw video data (C++)**

The `getRotationApplied` and `getMirrorApplied` callbacks can rotate and mirror the raw video data. To improve the user experience, this release expands the video-data formats supported by these callback functions from RGBA to RGBA and YUV 420.

**3. Playback progress of music files**

To control the playback progress of music files, this release deprecates the `startAudioMixing` method and adds a new method with the same name in its place. The new `startAudioMixing` method allows you to set the playback position when starting playback of a music file by using the `startPos` parameter.

**4. AirPlay callback**

This release adds support for reporting `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingAirPlay` in the `didAudioRouteChanged` callback on iOS devices. When you use Apple AirPlay to play audio on an iOS device, the SDK triggers the `didAudioRouteChanged` callback and reports `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingAirPlay`.

**5. Audio recording**

To set the recording configuration during audio recording, this release adds the `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` method and deprecates `startAudioRecording`2. The `config` parameter of the `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` method allows you to set the audio recording quality, content, sample rate, and storage path of the recording file.

This release also adds a new error code: `AgoraErrorCodeAlreadyInRecording(160)`. If you call the `startAudioRecordingWithConfig` method again before the current recording ends, the SDK reports this error code.

**6. Media device errors**

To help users better understand the cause of local video errors, this release adds a new error code to `AgoraLocalVideoStreamError`: `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorCaptureNoDeviceFound(8)`, which indicates that the SDK cannot find the local video-capture device.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- The video was upside down after you used `getMirrorApplied` to set the mirror mode under certain circumstances.
- You could not get the video data in the RGBA format from `onPreEncodeVideoFrame`.
- You could not use `getMirrorApplied` and `getRotationApplied` to process the local video data before encoding.
- The `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers` callback returned incorrect volume information after you called `enableSoundPositionIndication(YES)`.
- The local user would see the remote video upside down for an instant when the remote user switched between the front and rear cameras.
- The user interface of the application got stuck when you called `destroy` or the `get` method such as `getCallId` or `getSdkVersion` after calling `setupLocalVideo` or `setupRemoteVideo`.

## v3.3.2

v3.3.2 was released on March 29, 2021. This release fixed the following issues:

- Joining the channel occasionally failed when a user switched back to the app after keeping it in the background for a long time.
- Remote users saw a distorted image when the local user minimized the shared screen with the genie effect on Mac devices.

## v3.3.1

v3.3.1 was released on March 4, 2021.

#### New features

**Voice Conversion**

This release adds the `setVoiceConversionPreset` method to set a voice conversion effect (to disguise a user's voice). You can use this method to make a male-sounding voice sound steady or deep, and a female-sounding voice sound gender-neutral or sweet. See [Set the Voice Effect](../advanced-features/voice-changer).

#### Improvements

**1. AES-GCM encryption mode**

For scenarios requiring high security, to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data, and to improve the computational efficiency of data encryption, this release adds the following enumerators in `AgoraEncryptionMode`:

- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.
- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.

<div class="alert note">Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users such as the Agora recording service.</div>

**2. Remote audio statistics**

To monitor quality of experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream, this release adds `mosValue` to `remoteAudioStats`, which reports the quality of the remote audio stream as determined by the Agora real-time audio MOS (Mean Opinion Score) measurement system.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- After enabling the sound position indication, you could not get the remote user's volume by the  `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers` callback.
- Occasional crashes when you called `enableLocalVideo(NO)` while the application window was switching to Slide Over, Split View, or Picture in Picture mode.

#### API changes

This release adds the following APIs:
- [`setVoiceConversionPreset`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setVoiceConversionPreset:)
- `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM` and `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM` in [`AgoraEncryptionMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraEncryptionMode.html) 
- `mosValue` in [`AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html)

## v3.3.0

v3.3.0 was released on January 22, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

To meet Apple's requirements for using a simulator to run a project, this release changes the SDK package as follows:

- The format of all dynamic libraries changes from Framework to XCFramework. A dynamic library in XCFramework format supports running a project on both physical devices and simulators.
- The `ALL_ARCHITECTURE` folder is removed.

This release also adds `AgoraCore.xcframework`, the Agora basic calculation framework.

To integrate the SDK into your project, see [Integrate the SDK](../quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming).

**2. Changes to subscribing behavior**

This release deprecates `setDefaultMuteAllRemoteAudioStreams` and `setDefaultMuteAllRemoteVideoStreams `and changes the behavior of `mute`-related methods as follows:

- `mute`-related methods must be called after joining or switching to a channel; otherwise, the method call does not take effect.
- Methods with the prefix `muteAll` are no longer the master switch, and each `mute`-related method independently controls the user's subscribing state. When you call methods with the prefixes `muteAll` and `muteRemote` together, the method that is called later takes effect.
- Methods with the prefix `muteAll` set whether to subscribe to the audio or video streams of all remote users, including all subsequent users, which means methods with the prefix `muteAll` contain the function of methods with the prefix `setDefaultMute`. Agora recommends not calling methods with the prefixes `muteAll` and `setDefaultMute` together; otherwise, the setting may not take effect.

See details in [Set the Subscribing State](../best-practices/set-subscribing-state).

**3. Changes to voice activity behavior**

In the remote users' `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers` callback, this release changes the value of the `vad` member from always 0 to always 1.

#### New features

**1. Channel media options**

To help developers control media subscription more flexibly, this release adds the `joinChannelByToken`2 and `switchChannelByToken`2 methods to set whether users subscribe to all remote audio or video streams in a channel when joining and switching channels.

**2. Cloud proxy**

To improve the usability of the Agora Cloud Proxy, this release adds the `setCloudProxy` method to set the cloud proxy and allows you to select a cloud proxy that uses the UDP protocol. For details, see [Cloud Proxy](../basic-features/use-cloud-proxy).

**3. Deep-learning noise reduction**

To eliminate non-stationary noise based on traditional noise reduction, this release adds `enableDeepLearningDenoise` to enable deep-learning noise reduction.

Before enabling deep-learning noise reduction, integrate the `AgoraAIDenoiseExtension.xcframework` dynamic library into your project files.

**4. Singing beautifier**

To beautify the voice and add reverberation effects in a singing scenario, this release adds the `setVoiceBeautifierParameters` method and adds the `AgoraSingingBeautifier` constant to `AgoraVoiceBeautifierPreset`. 

You can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset(AgoraSingingBeautifier)` to beautify the male voice and add the reverberation effect for a voice in a small room. For more settings, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierParameters(AgoraSingingBeautifier, param1, param2)` to beautify male or female voices and add reverberation effects for a voice in a small room, large room, or hall. 

**5. Log files**

To ensure the integrity of log content, this release adds the `logConfig` property to `AgoraRtcEngineConfig`. You can use `logConfig` to set the log files output by the Agora SDK when you initialize `AgoraRtcEngineKit`. See [How can I set the log file?](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/log) for details.

As of v3.3.0, Agora does not recommend using the `setLogFile`, `setLogFileSize`, or `setLogFilter` methods to set the log files.

**6. Quality of captured video**

To control the quality of video captured by the local camera, this release adds support for customizing the capture resolution and listening for abnormalities.

- Customize the capture resolution: Call the `setCameraCapturerConfiguration` method to set the capture preference to `AgoraCameraCaptureOutputPreferenceManual(3)` and set the width and height of the captured video image.
- Listen for abnormalities:
  - The abnormal brightness level of captured video images: Use `captureBrightnessLevel` in the `localVideoStats` callback.
  - The camera fails to output the captured video: Use the `localVideoStateChange(AgoraLocalVideoStreamStateFailed, AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorCaptureFailure)` callback.
  - The camera repeatedly outputs the captured video: Use the `localVideoStateChange(AgoraLocalVideoStreamStateCapturing, AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorCaptureFailure)` callback.

To improve the user experience, this release adds the following reasons for local video capture errors in the `localVideoStateChange` callback:

- `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorCaptureInBackGround(6)`: The application is running in the background.
- `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorCaptureMultipleForegroundApps(7)`: The application is running in Slide Over, Split View, or Picture in Picture mode.

**7. Data streams**

To support scenarios such as lyrics synchronization and courseware synchronization, this release deprecates the previous `createDataStream` method and replaces it with a new method of the same name. You can use this new method to create a data stream and set whether to synchronize the data stream with the audio stream sent to the Agora channel and whether the received data is ordered.

#### Improvements

**1. Raw audio data**

This release adds raw audio data APIs for the iOS platform. Once you obtain raw audio data through the following APIs, you can pre-process or post-process it for desired playback effects:

- `setAudioFrameDelegate`
- `onRecordAudioFrame`
- `onPlaybackAudioFrame`
- `onMixedAudioFrame`
- `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing`

**2. Remote audio statistics**

To monitor quality of experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream, this release adds `qoeQuality` and `qualityChangedReason` to `AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats`, which report QoE of the local user and the reason for poor QoE, respectively.

#### API changes

## v3.2.1

v3.2.1 was released on December 17, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

- Crashes occurred when using IPv6.
- After you called `enableEncryption`, the SDK did not trigger the `firstLocalVideoFramePublished` callback.

## v3.2.0

v3.2.0 was released on November 30, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes
**1. Integration change**

Since v3.2.0, the following files have been added to the SDK package:

- `Agorafdkaac.framework`: The Fraunhofer FDK AAC dynamic library.
- `AgoraSoundTouch.framework`: The SoundTouch dynamic library.
- `Agoraffmpeg.framework`: The FFmpeg dynamic library.

If you upgrade the SDK to v3.2.0 or later, refer to the following steps to add the above dynamic libraries when integrating the SDK:

1. Copy the above files to the folder where the `AgoraRtcKit.framework` file is located.
2. Open **Xcode**, go to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** menu, click **+**, then click **Add Other…** to add `Agorafdkaac.framework`, `AgoraSoundTouch.framework`, and `Agoraffmpeg.framework`. Ensure the status of these dynamic libraries is **Embed & Sign**.

This release also merges `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework` into `AgoraRtcKit.framework`. After integrating `AgoraRtcKit.framework`, you can use built-in encryption directly.

**2. Cloud proxy**
This release optimizes the Agora cloud proxy architecture. If you are already using cloud proxy, to avoid compatibility issues between the new SDK and the old cloud proxy, please contact support@agora.io before upgrading the SDK. See [Cloud Proxy](../basic-features/use-cloud-proxy).

**3. Security and compliance**

Agora has passed ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO 27018 international certifications, providing safe and reliable real-time interactive cloud services for users worldwide. See [ISO Certificates](../reference/security#iso-certificates).

This release supports transport layer encryption by adding TLS (Transport Layer Security) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) encryption methods.

<div class="alert note">Transport layer encryption affects the following indicators:
<li>Size of the SDK package: For details, see *Product Overview*.</li>
<li>The rendering time of the first video frame: The rendering time (median) of the first video frame increases by 0 ~ 70 ms compared to that in v3.1.0.</li></div>

#### New features

**Interactive Live Streaming Standard**

This release adds `setClientRole` for setting the latency level of an audience member. You can use this method to switch between Interactive Live Streaming Premium and Interactive Live Streaming Standard as follows:

- Set the latency level as ultra low latency to use Interactive Live Streaming Premium.
- Set the latency level as low latency to use Interactive Live Streaming Standard.

For details, see the [product overview](../introduction/product-overview) of Interactive Live Streaming Standard. 

#### Improvements
**1. Local video quality**

This release improves the quality of the video captured by the local camera:

- This release optimizes the autofocus function of the rear camera.
- For video with a resolution not lower than 960 × 540 pixels, this release improves the local overexposure of the image under strong light by enabling the HDR attribute of the camera by default.

**2. Meeting scenario**

To improve the audio experience for multi-person meetings, this release adds `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting(8)` in `setAudioProfile`.

**3. Voice beautifier and audio effects**

To improve the usability of the APIs related to voice beautifier and audio effects, this release deprecates `setLocalVoiceChanger` and `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`, and adds the following methods instead:

- `setVoiceBeautifierPreset`: Compared with `setLocalVoiceChanger`, this method deletes audio effects such as a little boy’s voice and a more spatially resonant voice.
- `setAudioEffectPreset`: Compared with `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`, this method adds audio effects such as the 3D voice, the pitch correction, a little boy’s voice and a more spatially resonant voice.
- `setAudioEffectParameters`: This method sets detailed parameters for a specified audio effect. In this release, the supported audio effects are the 3D voice and pitch correction.

**4. Media Push with transcoding**

This release adds the `videoCodecType` member to the `AgoraLiveTranscoding` class for setting the codec type of the transcoded video stream to H.264 or H.265.

**5. Interactive streaming delay**

This release reduces the latency on the audience's client during an interactive live streaming by about 500 ms.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- On iPhone 5s and iPhone 6, after the user enabled the basic image enhancement function, the screen flickered when users switched between apps.
- The `stopChannelMediaRelay` method did not take effect.
- The SDK mistakenly returned the `AgoraErrorCodeAdmStartRecording(1012)` error.

## v3.1.2

v3.1.2 was released on September 14, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

To improve user experience, this version disables the local network connection quality report by default, to prevent the prompt to find local network devices from popping up when an end user launches the app on an iOS 14.0 device. The [`gatewayRtt`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/gatewayRtt) parameter in the [`reportRtcStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportRtcStats:) callback is disabled by default. Do not use `gatewayRtt` to obtain the round-trip delay between the client and the local router. See the [FAQ](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/local_network_privacy) for details.

If you do not mind the prompt, and want to enable the `gatewayRtt` parameter, please contact Agora technical support via [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When you use MediaIO to switch to a different video source, the screen gets frozen.
- When a remote user leaves the channel, the view of the remote user becomes black.
- The [`firstLocalVideoFrameWithSize`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:firstLocalVideoFrameWithSize:elapsed:) and [`firstRemoteVideoFrameOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:firstRemoteVideoFrameOfUid:size:elapsed:) callbacks are not triggered at the right time.

- Adds `txPacketLossRate` in `AgoraRtcLocalAudioStats`, which represents the audio packet loss rate (%) from the local client to the Agora edge server before applying anti-packet loss strategies.
- Adds the following attributes in `AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats`: 
  - `txPacketLossRate`: The video packet loss rate (%) from the local client to the Agora edge server before applying anti-packet loss strategies.
  - `captureFrameRate`: The capture frame rate (fps) of the local video.
- Adds `publishDuration` in `AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats` and `AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats`, which represents the total publish duration (ms) of the remote media stream.

**6. Audio profile**

To improve audio performance, this release adjusts the maximum audio bitrate of each audio profile as follows:

| Profile                                   | v3.1.0                                                       | Earlier than v3.1.0                                          |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AgoraAudioProfileDefault`                   | <li>For the interactive streaming profile: 64 Kbps</li><li>For the communication profile: 18 Kbps</li> | <li>For the interactive streaming profile: 52 Kbps</li><li>For the communication profile: 18 Kbps</li> |
| `AgoraAudioProfileSpeechStandard`           | 18 Kbps                                                      | 18 Kbps                                                      |

**7. Log files**

This release increases the default number of log files that the Agora SDK outputs from 2 to 5, and increases the default size of each log file from 512 KB to 1024 KB. By default, the SDK outputs five log files, `agorasdk.log`, `agorasdk_1.log`, `agorasdk_2.log`, `agorasdk_3.log`, `agorasdk_4.log`. The SDK writes the latest logs in `agorasdk.log`. When `agorasdk.log` is full, the SDK deletes the log file with the earliest modification time among the other four, renames `agorasdk.log` to the name of the deleted log file, and create a new `agorasdk.log` to record the latest logs.

**8. Video experience under poor network conditions**

- Starting with this release, the SDK automatically reduces video resolution under poor network conditions in order to improve the smoothness of the video.
- This release improves video quality by ensuring that the video does not become blurry due to changing network conditions.

**9. Others**

- This release improves the performance of some iOS models (using Apple A10 and below chips), reducing CPU utilization and memory footprint.
- This release reduces the playback time of the first remote audio frame.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- `setAudioMixingPitch` did not work when setting the `pitch` parameter to certain values.
- Occasional audio freeze when disconnecting from a Bluetooth device.
- The app did not receive the `setMediaMetadataDataSource` callback.
- Occasional crashes when the user left the channel after talking in multiple channels.

## v3.0.1.1

v3.0.1.1 was released on Jun 18, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

- Crashes after calling `registerVideoRenderFactory` (deprecated).
- The image enhancement feature does not work.

## v3.0.1

v3.0.1 was released on May 27, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Dynamic library**

This release replaces the static library with a dynamic library for the following reasons:

- Improving overall security.
- Avoiding incompatibility issues with other third-party libraries.
- Making it easier to upload the app to the App Store.

To upgrade the RTC Native SDK, you must re-integrate the dynamic library, `AgoraRtcKit.framework`.

<div class="alert note">Apple supports the dynamic library on iOS 13.4 and later.</div>

**2. Frame position for the video observer (C++)**

As of this release, to get the video frame from the `onPreEncodeVideoFrame` callback, you must set `POSITION_PRE_ENCODER(1<<2)` in [`getObservedFramePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#ad4c174389264630ffb1b2d24c6030013) as the frame position to observe, as well as implementing the `onPreEncodeVideoFrame` callback.

#### New features

**1. Audio mixing pitch**

To set the pitch of the local music file during audio mixing, this release adds `setAudioMixingPitch`. You can set the `pitch` parameter to increase or decrease the pitch of the music file. This method sets the pitch of the local music file only. It does not affect the pitch of a human voice.

**2. Voice enhancement**

To improve the audio quality, this release adds the following enumerate elements in `setLocalVoiceChanger` and `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`:

- `AgoraAudioVoiceChanger` adds several elements that have the prefixes `AgoraAudioVoiceBeauty` and `AgoraAudioGeneralBeautyVoice`. The `AgoraAudioVoiceBeauty` elements enhance the local voice, and the `AgoraAudioGeneralBeautyVoice` enumerations add gender-based enhancement effects.
- `AgoraAudioReverbPreset` adds the enumeration `AgoraAudioReverbPresetVirtualStereo` and several enumerations that have the prefix `AgoraAudioReverbPresetFx`. The `AgoraAudioReverbPresetVirtualStereo` enumeration implements reverberation in the virtual stereo, and the `AgoraAudioReverbPresetFx` enumerations implement additional enhanced reverberation effects.

See [Set the Voice Changer and Reverberation Effects](../advanced-features/voice-changer) for more information.

**3. Face detection**

This release enables local face detection. After you call `enableFaceDetection` to enable this function, the SDK triggers the `facePositionDidChangeWidth` callback in real time to report the detection results, including the distance between the human face and the device screen. This function can remind users to keep a certain distance from the screen.

**4. Fill mode**

To improve the user experience of watching videos, this release adds a video display mode `AgoraVideoRenderModeFill(4)`. This mode zooms and stretches the video to fill the display window. You can select this mode when calling the following methods:

- `setupLocalVideo`
- `setupRemoteVideo`
- `setLocalRenderMode`
- `setRemoteRenderMode`

**5. Remote video renderer in multiple channels**

This release adds `setRemoteVideoRenderer` and `remoteVideoRendererOfUserId` in the `AgoraRtcChannel` class to enable users who join the channel using the `AgoraRtcChannel` object to customize the remote video renderer.

**6. Data post-processing in multiple channels (C++)**

This release adds support for post-processing remote audio and video data in a multi-channel scenario by adding the following C++ methods:

- The `IAudioFrameObserver` class:  [`isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_audio_frame_observer.html#a4b6bdf2a975588cd49c2da2b6eff5956) and [`onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_audio_frame_observer.html#ab0cf02ba307e91086df04cda4355905b).
- The `IVideoFrameObserver` class: [`isMultipleChannelFrameWanted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#aa6bf2611907a097ec359b83f1e3ba49a) and [`onRenderVideoFrameEx`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#ad325db8ee3a04e667e6db3d1a84f381d).

After successfully registering the audio or video observer, if you set the return value of `isMultipleChannelFrameWanted` as `true`, you can get the corresponding audio or video data from `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx` or `onRenderVideoFrameEx`. In a multi-channel scenario, Agora recommends setting the return value as `true`.

#### Improvements

**Frame position (C++)**

After successfully registering the video observer, you can observe and get the video frame at each node of video processing. To conserve power consumption, this release enables customizing the frame position for the video observer. Set the return value of the [`getObservedFramePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#ad4c174389264630ffb1b2d24c6030013) callback to set the position to observe:

- The position after capturing the video frame.
- The position before receiving the remote video frame.
- The position before encoding the frame.

**Others**

- Improves in-call audio quality. When multiple users speak at the same time, the SDK does not decrease volume of any speaker.
- Reduces overall CPU usage of the device.

#### Fixed issues

- This release fixed issues with inaccurate report of the `didRemoteAudioStateChanged` callback, no audio, audio mixing and audio freezing.
- This release fixed issues that failure to end a call, and inaccurate report of the `didClientRoleChanged` callback.

#### API changes

This release adds the following APIs:

-  [`setAudioMixingPitch`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setAudioMixingPitch:)
- Several elements that have the prefixes `AgoraAudioVoiceBeauty` and `AgoraAudioGeneralBeautyVoice` in the [`AgoraAudioVoiceChanger`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioVoiceChanger.html) enumeration
- `AgoraAudioReverbPresetVirtualStereo` and several elements that have the prefixes `AgoraAudioReverbPresetFx` in the [`AgoraAudioReverbPreset`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioReverbPreset.html) enumeration
- [`enableFaceDetection`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableFaceDetection:)
- [`facePositionDidChangeWidth`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:facePositionDidChangeWidth:previewHeight:faces:)
- `AgoraVideoRenderModeFill` in the [`AgoraVideoRenderMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraVideoRenderMode.html) enumeration 
-  [`setRemoteVideoRenderer`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcChannel.html#//api/name/setRemoteVideoRenderer:forUserId:) and [`remoteVideoRendererOfUserId`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcChannel.html#//api/name/remoteVideoRendererOfUserId:) in the `AgoraRtcChannel` class
- `totalActiveTime` in the [`AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html) class
- `totalActiveTime` in the [`AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html) class

## v3.0.0.2

v3.0.0.2 was released on Apr 22, 2020.

#### New features

**Specifying the area of connection**

This release adds `sharedEngineWithConfig` for specifying the area of connection when creating an `AgoraRtcEngineKit` instance. This advanced feature applies to scenarios that have regional restrictions. You can choose from areas including Mainland China, North America, Europe, Asia (excluding Mainland China), and global (default).

After specifying the area of connection:

- When the app that integrates the Agora SDK is used within the specified area, it connects to the Agora servers within the specified area under normal circumstances.
- When the app that integrates the Agora SDK is used out of the specified area, it connects to the Agora servers either in the specified area or in the area where the SDK is located.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the occasional failure to connect to a Bluetooth headset.

#### API changes

**Added**

[`sharedEngineWithConfig`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/sharedEngineWithConfig:delegate:)

## v3.0.0

v3.0.0 was released on Mar 4, 2020.

On Mar 24, 2020, we fixed occasional issues relating to no audio, audio mixing, multiple `didClientRoleChanged` callbacks, and SDK crashes.

In this release, Agora improves the user experience under poor network conditions for both the `Communication` and `LiveBroadcasting` profiles through the following measures:

- Adopting a new architecture for the `Communication` profile.
- Upgrading the last-mile network strategy for both the `Communication` and `LiveBroadcasting` profiles,  which enhances the SDK's anti-packet-loss capacity by maximizing the net bitrate when the uplink and downlink bandwidth are insufficient.

To deal with any incompatibility issues caused by the architecture change, Agora uses the fallback mechanism to ensure that users of different versions of the SDKs can communicate with each other: if a user joins the channel from a client using a previous version, all clients using v3.0.0 automatically fall back to the older version. This has the effect that none of the users in the channel can enjoy the improved experience. Therefore we strongly recommend upgrading all your clients to v3.0.0.

We also upgrade the On-premise Recording SDK to v3.0.0. Ensure that you upgrade your On-premise Recording SDK to v3.0.0 so that all users can enjoy the improvements brought by the new architecture and network strategy.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Renaming the static library and adding support for dynamic library**

To unify the library names across platforms, this release renames the library from `AgoraRtcEngineKit.framework` to `AgoraRtcKit.framework`. If you upgrade your SDK to v3.0.0, you must re-import the `AgoraRtcKit` class. For details, see [Import the class](../quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming) in the Quickstart.

To improve your development experience, this release also adds support for the dynamic library. You can integrate either the static or the dynamic library in your project, and the name of the dynamic library package is Agora_Native_SDK_for_iOS_v3_0_0_FULL_Dynamic. 

Integrating the dynamic library has the following advantages:

- The overall security level is improved.
- Incompatibility issues with other third-party libraries are avoided.
- Uploading the app onto App Store is easier.

If you prefer the dynamic library, you need to re-integrate the SDK and re-import the `AgoraRtcKit` class. This process should take no more than five minutes. See [Integrate the SDK](../quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming) and [Import the class](../quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming) in the Quickstart.

<div class="alert info" />The following table shows the difference in the file size when generating ipa files with a dynamic and static library:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Library type</b></td>
        <td><b>ipa size (M)</b></td>
        <td><b>Decompressed ipa size (M)</b></td>
        <td><b>Frameworks folder size (M)</b></td>
        <td><b>Binary file size (M)</b></td>
        <td><b>Total size of frameworks folder + binary file (M)</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dynamic library</td>
        <td>31.1</td>
        <td>65</td>
        <td>51.47</td>
        <td>2.4</td>
        <td>53.87</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Static library</td>
        <td>30.6</td>
        <td>63.7</td>
        <td>30.1</td>
        <td>22.5</td>
        <td>52.6</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The dynamic library is located in the framework folder as an independent library. Note that the corresponding binary file size does not include the SDK size. Overall, this decreases the binary file size by 20.1 M and increases the framework folder size by 21.37 M.

**2. Dual-stream mode not enabled in the Communication profile**

As of v3.0.0, the native SDK does not enable the [dual-stream mode](../reference/glossary#dual-stream-mode) by default in the `Communication` profile. Call the [`enableDualStreamMode (YES)`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableDualStreamMode:) method after joining the channel to enable it. In video scenarios with multiple users, we recommend enabling the dual-stream mode.

#### New features

**1. Multiple channel management**

To enable a user to join an unlimited number of channels at a time, this release adds the [`AgoraRtcChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcChannel.html) and [`AgoraRtcChannelDelegate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcChannelDelegate.html) classes. By creating multiple `AgoraRtcChannel` objects, a user can join the corresponding channels at the same time.

After joining multiple channels, users can receive the audio and video streams of all the channels, but publish one stream to only one channel at a time. This feature applies to scenarios where users need to receive streams from multiple channels, or frequently switch between channels to publish streams. See [Join Multiple Channels](../../../interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/multiple-channel) for details.

**2. Raw video data**
Adds the following C++ callbacks to the `IVideoFrameObserver` class to provide raw video data at different video transmission stages, and to accommodate more scenarios.

- `onPreEncodeVideo`: Gets the video data after pre-processing and prior to encoding. This method applies to the scenarios where you need to pre-process the video data.
- `getSmoothRenderingEnabled`: Sets whether to smooth the acquired video frames. The smoothed video frames are more evenly spaced, providing a better rendering experience.

**3. Adjusting the playback volume of the specified remote user**

Adds [`adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume:volume:) for adjusting the playback volume of a specified remote user. You can call this method as many times as necessary in a call or interactive live streaming to adjust the playback volume of different remote users, or to repeatedly adjust the playback volume of the same remote user.

**4. Agora Mediaplayer Kit**

To enrich the playability of the interactive live streaming, Agora releases the Mediaplayer Kit plug-in, which supports the host playing local or online media resources and sharing them with all users in the channel during the interactive live streaming. See [Mediaplayer Kit release notes](../reference/mpk-release) for details.

#### Improvements

**1. Audio profiles**

To meet the need for higher audio quality, this release adjusts the corresponding audio profile of `AgoraAudioProfileDefault(0)` in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile.

| SDK   | `AgoraAudioProfileDefault(0)`                                  |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| v3.0.0      | A sample rate of 48 KHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 52 Kbps. |
| Earlier than v3.0.0 | A sample rate of 32 KHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 52 Kbps. |

**2. Mirror mode**

The mirror mode determines how the SDK mirrors the video in different stages of transmission. This release supports setting the video mirror mode when encoding and rendering the video:

- Setting a mirror mode for the stream to be encoded: This release adds the `mirrorMode` member to the [`AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html) struct struct for setting a mirror effect for the stream to be encoded and transmitted.
- Setting a mirror mode for the streams to be rendered: 
	- We add the `mirrorMode` member to the [`AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcVideoCanvas.html) struct. You can use [`setupLocalVideo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setupLocalVideo:), to set a mirror effect for the local view, or use [`setupRemoteVideo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setupRemoteVideo:) to set a mirror effect for the remote view on the local device.
	- This release also adds the [`setLocalRenderMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/v3.0.0/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalRenderMode:mirrorMode:) and [`setRemoteRenderMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/v3.0.0/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteRenderMode:renderMode:mirrorMode:) methods, both of which take an extra `mirrorMode` parameter. During a call, you can use `setLocalRenderMode` to update the mirror effect of the local view or `setRemoteRenderMode` to update the mirror effect of the remote view on the local device.

**3. Quality statistics**

Adds the following members in the [`AgoraChannelStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html) class for providing more in-call statistics, making it easier to monitor the call quality and memory usage in real time:

- `gatewayRtt`
- `memoryAppUsageRatio`
- `memoryTotalUsageRatio`
- `memoryAppUsageInKbytes`

**4. Others**

This release enables interoperability between the Native SDK and the Web SDK by default, and deprecates the `enableWebSdkInteroperability` method.

#### Issues fixed

- Audio issues concerning audio mixing, audio encoding, and echo.
- Video issues concerning the watermark, video aspect ratio, video sharpness, full-screen video, and black outline during the screen share.
- Other issues related to app crashes, log file, and unstable service when pushing streams to the CDN.

#### API changes

**Behavior change**

Calling [`enableLocalAudio (NO)`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableLocalAudio:) does not change the in-call volume to media volume.

**Added**

- [`setRemoteRenderMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/v3.0.0/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteRenderMode:renderMode:mirrorMode:) 
- The `mirrorMode` parameter in the [`AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html) struct
- The `mirrorMode` and `channelId` parameter in the [`AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcVideoCanvas.html) struct
- The `channelId` parameter in the [`AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo.html) struct
- [`createRtcChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/createRtcChannel:)
- [`AgoraRtcChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcChannel.html) class
- [`AgoraRtcChannelDelegate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcChannelDelegate.html) class
- The `gatewayRtt`, `memoryAppUsageRatio`, `memoryTotalUsageRatio` and `memoryAppUsageInKbytes` members in the [`AgoraChannelStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html) class

**Deprecated**

- `enableWebSdkInteroperability`
- `setLocalRenderMode`¹. Use the new [`setLocalRenderMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/v3.0.0/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalRenderMode:mirrorMode:) method instead.
- `setRemoteRenderMode`¹. Use the new [`setRemoteRenderMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/v3.0.0/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteRenderMode:renderMode:mirrorMode:) method instead.
- `setLocalVideoMirrorMode`. Use the `mirrorMode` parameter in the [`setupLocalVideo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setupLocalVideo:) and [`setLocalRenderMode`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/v3.0.0/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalRenderMode:mirrorMode:) methods instead.
- `firstRemoteAudioFrameDecodedOfUid` and `firstRemoteAudioFrameOfUid`. Use the [`remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid:state:reason:elapsed:) callback instead.
- `streamPublishedWithUrl` and `streamUnpublishedWithUrl`. Use the [`rtmpStreamingChangedToState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:rtmpStreamingChangedToState:state:errorCode:) callback instead.

## v2.9.3

<div class="alert note">As of December 8, 2021, Agora begins implementing the retirement process for the Voice SDK and Video SDK for native platforms and third-party frameworks earlier than v3.0.0. See <a href="../introduction/service-sunset-plans">Service Sunset Plans</a>.</div>

v2.9.3 was released on Feb 10, 2020.

This release fixed the following issues:

- The `setRemoteSubscribeFallbackOption method`, which should work in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile only, also works in the `Communication` profile.
- In some one-to-one communication, the downlink media stream falls back to audio-only under poor network conditions.
- In scenarios involving custom video source, the resolution of the received video frame changes as the app switches between the foreground and the background.

## v2.9.1
v2.9.1 is released on Sep 19, 2019.

#### New features

**1. Detecting local voice activity**

This release adds the `report_vad(bool)` parameter to the [`enableAudioVolumeIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableAudioVolumeIndication:smooth:report_vad:) method to enable local voice activity detection. Once it is enabled, you can check the [`AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo.html) struct of the [`reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers:totalVolume:) callback for the voice activity status of the local user.

**2. Choosing front and rear cameras**

Users can select the front or rear camera before joining a channel. This release adds the `AgoraCameraDirection` member variable to the [`AgoraCameraCapturerConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraCameraCapturerConfiguration.html) class to accomplish this. Choose the front or rear camera by selecting `AgoraCameraDirectionRear(1)` or `AgoraCameraDirectionFront(0)` respectively.

**3. Supporting RGBA raw video data**

This release supports RGBA raw video data. Use the C++ method [`getVideoFormatPreference`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#a440e2a33140c25dfd047d1b8f7239369) to set the format of the raw video data format.

You can also rotate or mirror the RGBA raw data using the C++ methods [`getRotationApplied`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#afd5bb439a9951a83f08d8c0a81468dcb) or [`getMirrorApplied`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#afc5cce81bf1c008e9335a0423ca45991) respectively.

#### Improvements

**1. Improving the watermark function in interactive live streaming**

This release adds a new [`addVideoWatermark`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/addVideoWatermark:options:) method with the following settings:

- The `visibleInPreview` member sets whether the watermark is visible in the local preview.
- The `positionInLandscapeMode`/`positionInPortraitMode` member sets the watermark position when the encoding video is in landscape/portrait mode.

This release optimizes the watermark function, reducing the CPU usage by 5% to 20%.

The original `addVideoWatermark` method is deprecated.

**2. Supporting more audio sample rates for recording**

To enable more audio sample rate options for recording, this release adds a new [`startAudioRecording`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startAudioRecording:sampleRate:quality:) method with a `sampleRate` parameter. In the new method, you can set the sample rate as 16, 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz. The original method supports only a fixed sample rate of 32 kHz and is deprecated.

#### Issues fixed

**Audio**

- Audio freezes.
- Abnormal audio when a user rejoins the channel after a third-party app interrupts the call.
- Echoes occur when a user is in a channel.

**Miscellaneous**

- The remote users do not receive the [`didUpdatedUserInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didUpdatedUserInfo:withUid:) callback when the local user switches the network connection before joining the channel and calls the [`joinChannelByUserAccount`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByUserAccount:token:channelId:joinSuccess:) method.
- Mixing streams occur in Media Push.

#### API changes

To improve the user experience, we made the following changes in v2.9.1:

**Added**

- [`startAudioRecording`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startAudioRecording:sampleRate:quality:)
- [`addVideoWatermark`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/addVideoWatermark:options:)
- [`getVideoFormatPreference`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#a440e2a33140c25dfd047d1b8f7239369)
- [`getRotationApplied`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#afd5bb439a9951a83f08d8c0a81468dcb)
- [`getMirrorApplied`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1media_1_1_i_video_frame_observer.html#afc5cce81bf1c008e9335a0423ca45991)
- The `report_vad` parameter in the [`enableAudioVolumeIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableAudioVolumeIndication:smooth:report_vad:) method
- The `vad` member in the [`AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo.html) class
- The `AgoraCameraDirection` member in the [`AgoraCameraCapturerConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraCameraCapturerConfiguration.html) class

**Deprecated**

- `startAudioRecording`
- `addVideoWatermark`

## v2.9.0
v2.9.0 is released on Aug. 16, 2019.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Media Push**

In this release, we deleted the following methods:

- `configPublisher`
- `setVideoCompositingLayout`
- `clearVideoCompositingLayout`

If your app implements Media Push with the methods above, ensure that you upgrade the SDK to the latest version and use the following methods for the same function:

- [`setLiveTranscoding`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLiveTranscoding:)
- [`addPublishStreamUrl`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/addPublishStreamUrl:transcodingEnabled:)
- [`removePublishStreamUrl`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/removePublishStreamUrl:)
- [`rtmpStreamingChangedToState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:rtmpStreamingChangedToState:state:errorCode:)

For how to implement the new methods, see [Media Push](../advanced-features/media-push).

**2. Reporting the state of the remote video**

This release extends the [`remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid:state:reason:elapsed:) callback with more states of the remote video: Stopped(0), Starting(1), Decoding(2), Frozen(3), and Failed(4). It adds a reason parameter to the callback to indicate why the remote video state changes. The original `remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid` callback is deleted. If you upgrade your Native SDK to the latest version, ensure that you re-implement the [`remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid:state:reason:elapsed:) callback.

The new callback reports most of the remote video states, and therefore deprecates the [`firstRemoteVideoDecodedOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:firstRemoteVideoDecodedOfUid:size:elapsed:) callback. You can still use it, but we do not recommend doing so.

<div class="alert note">The triggering timing of the new callback is different from the old one. The new <code>remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid</code> callback is triggered only when the remote video state has changed.</div>

**3. Disabling/enabling the local audio**

To improve the audio quality in the `Communication` profile, this release sets the system volume to the media volume after you call the `enableLocalAudio`(true) method. Calling `enableLocalAudio`(false) switches the system volume back to the in-call volume.

#### New features

**1. Faster switching to another channel**

This release adds the [`switchChannelByToken`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/switchChannelByToken:channelId:joinSuccess:) method to enable the audience in an interactive streaming channel to quickly switch to another channel. With this method, you can achieve a much faster switch than with the [`leaveChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/leaveChannel:) and [`joinChannelByToken`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByToken:channelId:info:uid:joinSuccess:) methods. After the audience successfully switches to another channel by calling the [`switchChannelByToken`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/switchChannelByToken:channelId:joinSuccess:) method, the SDK triggers the [`didLeaveChannelWithStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didLeaveChannelWithStats:) and [`didJoinChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed:) callbacks to indicate that the audience has left the original channel and joined a new one. 

**2. Channel media stream relay**

This release adds the following methods to relay the media streams of a host from a source channel to a destination channel. This feature applies to scenarios such as online singing contests, where hosts of different interactive streaming channels interact with each other.

- [`startChannelMediaRelay`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startChannelMediaRelay:)
- [`updateChannelMediaRelay`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/updateChannelMediaRelay:)
- [`stopChannelMediaRelay`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/stopChannelMediaRelay)

During the media stream relay, the SDK reports the states and events of the relay with the  [`channelMediaRelayStateDidChange`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:channelMediaRelayStateDidChange:error:) and [`didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent:) callbacks.

For more information on the implementation, API call sequence, sample code, and considerations, see [Co-host across Channels](../../../interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/media-relay).

**3. Reporting the local and remote audio state**

This release adds the [`localAudioStateChange`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localAudioStateChange:error:) and [`remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid:state:reason:elapsed:) callbacks to report the local and remote audio states. With these callbacks, the SDK reports the following states for the local and remote audio:

- The local audio: Stopped(0), Recording(1), Encoding(2), or Failed(3). When the state is Failed(3), see the `error` parameter for troubleshooting.
- The remote audio: Stopped(0), Starting(1), Decoding(2), Frozen(3), or Failed(4). See the `reason` parameter for why the remote audio state changes.

**4. Reporting the local audio statistics**

This release adds the [`localAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localAudioStats:) callback to report the statistics of the local audio during a call, including the number of channels, the sending sample rate, and the average sending bitrate of the local audio.

**5. Pulling the remote audio data**

To improve the experience in audio playback, this release adds the following methods to pull the remote audio data. After getting the audio data, you can process it and play it with the audio effects that you want.

- [`enableExternalAudioSink`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableExternalAudioSink:channels:)
- [`disableExternalAudioSink`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/disableExternalAudioSink)
- [`pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData:lengthInByte:)
- [`pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte:)

The difference between the `onPlaybackAudioFrame` callback and the `pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData` / `pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte` method is as follows:

- `onPlaybackAudioFrame`: The SDK sends the audio data to the app once every 10 ms. Any delay in processing the audio frames may result in an audio delay.
- `pullPlaybackAudioFrameRawData` / `pullPlaybackAudioFrameSampleBufferByLengthInByte`: The app pulls the remote audio data. After setting the audio data parameters, the SDK adjusts the frame buffer and avoids problems caused by jitter in external audio playback.

#### Improvements

**1. Reporting more statistics of the in-call quality**

This release adds the following statistics in the [`AgoraChannelStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html), [`AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html), and [`AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html) classes:

- `AgoraChannelStats`: The total number of the sent audio bytes, sent video bytes,  received audio bytes, and received video bytes during a session.
- `AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats`: The encoding bitrate, the width and height of the encoding frame, the number of frames, and the codec type of the local video.
- `AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats`: The packet loss rate of the remote video.

**2. Improving the video quality of interactive live streaming**

This release minimizes the video freeze rate under poor network conditions, improves the video sharpness, and optimizes the video smoothness when the packet loss rate is high.

**3. Other Improvements**

- Improves the audio quality when the audio scenario is set to `GameStreaming`.
- Improves the audio quality after the user disables the microphone in the `Communication` profile.

#### Issues fixed

**Audio**

- When interoperating with a Web app, voice distortion occurs after the native app enables the remote sound position indication.
- Audio freezes when the audience in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile sets the audio session category to playback.
- No audio after a Web app joins the channel when the remote sound position indication is enabled.

**Video**

- Occasional crashes occur when setting the video encoder configuration after joining the channel.
- Crashes occur when repeatedly changing the video resolution after joining the channel.

**Miscellaneous**

- Occasionally mixed streams in Media Push. 
- Crashes occur after calling the [`leaveChannel`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/leaveChannel:) method.

## v2.8.0

v2.8.0 is released on Jul. 8, 2019.

#### New features

**1. Supporting string user IDs**

Many apps use string user IDs. This release adds the following methods to enable apps to join an Agora channel directly with string user IDs as user accounts:

- [registerLocalUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/registerLocalUserAccount:appId:)
- [joinChannelByUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByUserAccount:token:channelId:joinSuccess:)

For other methods, Agora uses the integer uid parameter. The Agora Engine maintains a mapping table that contains the user ID and string user account, and you can get the corresponding user account or ID by calling the getUserInfoByUid or getUserInfoByUserAccount method.

To ensure smooth communication, use the same parameter type to identify all users within a channel, that is, all users should use either the integer user ID or the string user account to join a channel. 

**Note**:
- Do not mix parameter types within the same channel. The following Agora SDKs support string user accounts:
	- The Native SDK: v2.8.0 and later.
	- The Web SDK: v2.5.0 and later.

 If you use SDKs that do not support string user accounts, only integer user IDs can be used in the channel.
- If you change your user IDs into string user accounts, ensure that all app clients are upgraded to the latest version.
- If you use string user accounts, ensure that the token generation script on your server is updated to the latest version. If you join the channel with a user account, ensure that you use the same user account or its corresponding integer user ID to generate a token. Call the `getUserInfoByUserAccount` method to get the user ID that corresponds to the user account.

**2. Adding remote audio and video statistics**

To monitor the audio and video transmission quality during a call or interactive live streaming, this release adds the `totalFrozenTime` and `frozenRate` members in the [AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html) and [AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html) classes, to report the audio and video freeze time and freeze rate of the remote user.

This release also adds the `numChannels`, `receivedSampleRate`, and `receivedBitrate` members in the [AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats.html) class.

#### Improvements

This release adds a `AgoraConnectionChangedKeepAliveTimeout(14)` member to the `AgoraConnectionChangedReason` parameter of the [connectionChangedToState](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:connectionChangedToState:reason:) callback. This member indicates a connection state change caused by the timeout of the connection keep-alive between the SDK and Agora's edge server.

#### Issues Fixed

- Unexpected behaviors when calling the `setRemoteSubscribeFallbackOption` method.
- Occasional deadlocks when calling the `MediaIO` methods.

#### API Changes

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

**Added**

- [registerLocalUserAccount](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/registerLocalUserAccount:appId:)

## v2.4.1

V2.4.1 is released on Jun 12th, 2019.

#### Compatibility changes

Ensure that you read the following SDK behavior changes if you migrate from an earlier SDK version.

**1. Publishing streams to the RTMP**

To improve the usability of the Media Push service, v2.4.1 defines the following parameter limits:

| Class **/** Interface  | Parameter Limit                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [AgoraLiveTranscoding](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html)        | <li>[videoFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/videoFramerate): Frame rate (fps) of the CDN live output video stream. The value range is [0, 30], and the default value is 15. Agora adjusts all values over 30 to 30.</li><li>[videoBitrate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/videoBitrate): Bitrate (Kbps) of the RTMP live output video stream. The default value is 400. Set this parameter according to the [Video Bitrate Table](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html#//api/name/bitrate). If you set a bitrate beyond the proper range, the SDK automatically adapts it to a value within the range.</li><li>[videoCodecProfile](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/videoCodecProfile): The video codec profile. Set it as **BASELINE**, **MAIN**, or **HIGH** (default). If you set this parameter to other values, Agora adjusts it to the default value of **HIGH**.</li><li>[size](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/size): Pixel of the video. The minimum value of size is **16 x 16**.</li> |
| [AgoraImage](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraImage.html)             | url: The maximum length of this parameter is **1024** bytes. |
| [addPublishStreamUrl](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/addPublishStreamUrl:transcodingEnabled:)     | url: The maximum length of this parameter is **1024** bytes. |
| [removePublishStreamUrl](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/removePublishStreamUrl:) | url: The maximum length of this parameter is **1024** bytes. |

This release also adds the  [audioCodecProfile](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraLiveTranscoding.html#//api/name/audioCodecProfile) parameter in the `LiveTranscoding` class to set the audio codec profile type. The default type is LC-AAC, which means the low-complexity audio codec profile.

v2.4.1 also adds five error codes to the error parameter in the [streamPublishedWithUrl](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/removePublishStreamUrl:) method for quick troubleshooting.

**2. Renaming the receivedFrameRate parameter i**
n the RemoteVideoStats class

v2.4.1 renames the `receivedFrameRate` parameter to [rendererOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html#//api/name/rendererOutputFrameRate) in the [AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html) class to more accurately describe the statistics of the remote video stream.

#### New features

**1. Adding media metadata**

In interactive live streaming scenarios, the host can send shopping links, digital coupons, and online quizzes to the audience for more diversified interactive live streaming interactions. v2.4.1 adds the [setMediaMetadataSource](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setMediaMetadataDataSource:withType:) and the [setMediaMetadataDelegate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setMediaMetadataDelegate:withType:) interface and the [AgoraMediaMetadataDataSource](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraMediaMetadataDataSource.html) and the [AgoraMediaMetadataDelegate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraMediaMetadataDelegate.html) protocol, allowing the host to add metadata to the output video and to send media attached information.

**2. State of the local video**

v2.4.1 adds the [localVideoStateChange](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localVideoStateChange:error:) callback to indicate the local video state. In this callback, the SDK returns the `Stopped`,` Capturing`, `Encoding`, or `Failed` state. When the state is `Failed`, you can use the error code for troubleshooting. This callback indicates whether or not the interruption is caused by capturing or encoding. This release deprecates the `rtcEngineCameraDidReady` and `rtcEngineVideoDidStop` callbacks.

**3. State of the Media Push**

v2.4.1 adds the [rtmpStreamingChangedToState](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:rtmpStreamingChangedToState:state:errorCode:) callback to indicate the state of the Media Push and help you troubleshoot issues when exceptions occur. In this callback, the SDK returns the `Idle`, `Connecting`, `Runing`, `Recovering`, or `Failure` state. When the state is `Failure`, you can use the error code for troubleshooting. You can still use the `streamPublishedWithUrl` and `streamUnpublishedWithUrl` callbacks, but we do not recommend using them.

**4. More reasons for a network connection state change**

In the onConnectionStateChanged callback, v2.4.1 adds error codes to the reason parameter to help you troubleshoot issues when exceptions occur. The SDK returns the [connectionChangedToState](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:connectionChangedToState:reason:) callback whenever the connection state changes. This release also deprecates `AgoraWarningCodeLookupChannelRejected(105)`, `AgoraErrorCodeTokenExpired(109)`, and `AgoraErrorCodeInvalidToken(110)`.

**5. State of the local network type **

v2.4.1 adds the [networkTypeChangedToType](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:networkTypeChangedToType:) callback to indicate the local network type. In this callback, the SDK returns the `Unknown`, `Disconnected`, `Lan`, `Wifi`, `2G`, `3G`, or `4G` type. When the network connection is interrupted, this callback indicates whether or not the interruption is caused by a network type change or poor network conditions.

**6. Getting the audio mixing volume**

v2.4.1 adds the  [getAudioMixingPlayoutVolume](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume:) and [getAudioMixingPublishVolume](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume:) methods, which respectively gets the audio mixing volume for local playback and remote playback, to help you troubleshoot audio volume related issues.

**7. Reporting when the first remote audio frame is received and decoded**

To get the more accurate time of the first audio frame from a specified remote user, v2.4.1 adds the [firstRemoteAudioFrameDecodedOfUid](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:firstRemoteAudioFrameDecodedOfUid:elapsed:) callback to report to the app that the SDK decodes first remote audio. This callback is triggered in either of the following scenarios:

- The remote user joins the channel and sends the audio stream.
- The remote user stops sending the audio stream and re-sends it after 15 seconds.

The difference between the onFirstRemoteAudioDecoded and `onFirstRemoteAudioFrame` callbacks is that the `onFirstRemoteAudioFram`e callback occurs when the SDK receives the first audio packet. It occurs before the `onFirstRemoteAudioDecoded` callback.


#### Improvements

**1. Playing multiple online audio effect files simultaneously**

v2.4.1 adds the support for playing multiple online audio effect files simultaneously by allowing you to call the [playEffect](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/playEffect:filePath:loopCount:pitch:pan:gain:publish:) method multiple times with the URLs of the online audio effect files.

**2. Reporting more statistics**

- v2.4.1 adds the [txPacketLossRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/txPacketLossRate) and  [rxPacketLossRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html#//api/name/rxPacketLossRate) parameters in the  [AgoraChannelStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraChannelStats.html) class. These parameters return the packet loss rate from the local client to the server and vice versa.

- To provide more accurate statistics of the local and remote video, v2.4.1 makes the following changes to the following classes:
  - [AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html): Adds the  [encoderOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/encoderOutputFrameRate) and [rendererOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/rendererOutputFrameRate) parameters
  - [AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html): Adds the [decoderOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html#//api/name/decoderOutputFrameRate) parameter, and renames the receivedFrameRate parameter to the [rendererOutputFrameRate](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats.html#//api/name/rendererOutputFrameRate) parameter

**3. Image enhancement**

v2.4.1 assigns default values to various parameters in the  [AgoraBeautyOptions](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraBeautyOptions.html) class to improve the image enhancement experience. This release also optimizes the image enhancement algorithm. Test results from Agora Lab suggest that the updated algorithm leads to lower GPU and CPU consumption. The power consumption is optimized by 40% - 50%.

**4. Miscellaneous**

- Improved the sound quality of the GameStreaming audio scenario.
- Reduced the audio and video latency.
- Reduced the SDK package size by 0.5 M.
- Improved the accuracy of the network quality after users change the video bitrate.
- Enabled the audio quality notification callback by default, that is, enabled the [remoteAudioStats](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStats:) callback without calling the `enableAudioVolumeIndication` method.
- Improved the stability of video services.
- Improved the stability of Media Push.

#### Issues fixed

**Audio**

- The audio stream is interrupted by Siri and does not resume. 

**Video**

- Camera exposure issues. 
- The user cannot see the remote video on the smartwatch. 

**Miscellaneous**

- Users still receive the `onNetworkQuality` callback after leaving the channel.
- Occasional crashes.


#### API changes

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

**Unified the C++ interface for all platforms**

v2.4.1 unifies the behavior of the C++ interfaces across different platforms so that you can apply the same code logic on different platforms. v2.4.1 implements the methods of the `RtcEngineParameters` class in the `IRtcEngine` class. Refer to [Agora C++ API Reference for All Platforms home page](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//index.html) for the applicable platforms and considerations of each interface.

## v2.4.0 and Earlier

**v2.4.0**

v2.4.0 is released on April 1, 2019.

#### **Compatibility changes**

- Agora Video SDK for iOS adds a library dependency on `CoreML.framework` in v2.4.0. Ensure that you add this library when integrating the SDK. For details, see *Integrate the SDK*.
- If you integrate the SDK by using CocoaPods，ensure that you run `pod update` in your Terminal before `pod install`. If you prefer to specify the SDK version to obtain the latest release, ensure that you specify it as `'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '2.4.0.1'` in the Podfile.

#### **New Features**

##### 1. Image enhancement

In scenarios such as the video chat, interactive streaming, and online education, basic beautification is a popular feature. v2.4.0 adds the [`setBeautyEffectOptions`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setBeautyEffectOptions:options:) method, allowing you to adjust the contrast, brightness, smoothness and red saturation of an image. For more information, see [Image Enhancement](image_enhancement_ios).

##### 2. Voice changer and voice reverberation

Adding voice changer and reverberation effects in an audio chat room brings much more fun. v2.4.0 adds the [`setLocalVoiceChanger`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalVoiceChanger:) and [`setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLocalVoiceReverbPreset:) methods, allowing you to change your voice or reverberation by choosing from the preset options. See [Adjust the pitch and tone](../advanced-features/voice-changer).

##### 3. Tracking the sound position of a remote user 

v2.4.0 adds the [`enableSoundPositionIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableSoundPositionIndication:) and [`setRemoteVoicePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteVoicePosition:pan:gain:) methods. Call the [`enableSoundPositionIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/enableSoundPositionIndication:) method before joining a channel to enable stereo panning for the remote users, and then you can call the [`setRemoteVoicePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteVoicePosition:pan:gain:) method to track the position of a remote user.

##### 4. Pre-call last-mile network probe test

Conducting a last-mile probe test before joining the channel helps the local user to evaluate or predict the uplink network conditions. v2.4.0 adds the [`startLastmileProbeTest`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startLastmileProbeTest:), [`stopLastmileProbeTest`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/stopLastmileProbeTest), and [`lastmileProbeResult`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:lastmileProbeTestResult:) APIs, allowing you to get the uplink and downlink last-mile network statistics, including the bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, and round-trip time (RTT).

##### 5.Setting the priority of a remote user's stream

v2.4.0 adds the [`setRemoteUserPriority`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteUserPriority:type:) method for setting the priority of a remote user's media stream. You can use this method with the [`setRemoteSubscribeFallbackOption`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setRemoteSubscribeFallbackOption:) method. If the fallback function is enabled for a remote stream, the SDK ensures the high-priority user gets the best possible stream quality.

##### 6. State of an audio mixing file 

v2.4.0 adds the [`localAudioMixingStateDidChanged`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:localAudioMixingStateDidChanged:errorCode:) callback to report any change of the audio-mixing file playback state (playback succeeds or fails) and the corresponding reason. This release also adds the warning code 701, which is triggered if the local audio-mixing file does not exist, or if the SDK does not support the file format or cannot access the music file URL when playing the audio-mixing file.

##### 7. Setting the log file size

The SDK has two log files, each with a default size of 512 KB. In case some customers require more than the default size, v2.4.0 adds the [`setLogFileSize`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLogFileSize:) method for setting the log file size (KB).

#### 8. Cloud proxy

Supports the cloud proxy service. See [Use Cloud Proxy](../basic-features/use-cloud-proxy) for details.

#### **Improvements**

##### 1. Accuracy of call quality statistics

- v2.4.0 replaces the [`startEchoTest`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startEchoTest:) method with the [`startEchoTestWithInterval`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/startEchoTestWithInterval:successBlock:) method. The `intervalInSeconds` parameter of `startEchoTestWithIntervals` allows you to set the interval between when you speak and when the recording plays back.
- v2.4.0 adds three parameters to the [`AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html) class: [`sentTargetBitrate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/sentTargetBitrate) for setting the target bitrate of the current encoder, [`sentTargetFrameRate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/sentTargetFrameRate) for setting the target frame rate, and [`qualityAdaptIndication`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcLocalVideoStats.html#//api/name/qualityAdaptIndication) for reporting the quality of the local video since last count.

##### 2. Video encoder preferences

v2.4.0 provides the following options for setting video encoder preferences:

- Setting preferences under limited bandwidth. v2.4.0 adds two parameters to the [`AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html) class: [`minFrameRate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html#//api/name/minFrameRate) and [`degradationPreference`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html#//api/name/degradationPreference). You can use these parameters together to set the minimum video encoder frame rate and the video encoding degradation preference under limited bandwidth. For more information, see [Set the Video Profile](video_profile_apple).
- Setting the camera capture preference. v2.4.0 adds the [`setCameraCapturerConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setCameraCapturerConfiguration:) method, allowing you to set the camera capture preference. You can choose system performance over video quality or vice versa as needed. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setCameraCapturerConfiguration).

##### 3. Core quality improvements

- Reduces the audio delay.
- Improves the video quality and stability. 
- Shortens the time to render the first remote video frame. 

#### **Issues Fixed**

##### Audio

- Calling the `enableLocalAudio` method disconnects all connected Bluetooth devices.
- The SDK does not support audio mixing URLs with Chinese characters.
- The SDK does not return YES after the `pushExternalAudioFrameSampleBuffer` method call succeeds.
- Volume levels of the high-pitch sound are lowered.
- Sounds are occasionally played fast.

##### Video

- If you skip the `renderMode` setting, the video stretches due to a mismatch with the display.
- Video freezes on some lower-end devices.
- It takes too long to render the first received video frame.

##### Miscellaneous

- The user drop-offline time between Android and iOS is not unified.
- The SEI information does not synchronize with the media stream when publishing transcoded streams to the CDN.

#### **API Changes**

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

##### Added

- [`setBeautyEffectOptions`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setBeautyEffectOptions:options:)

- [`lastmileProbeResult`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:lastmileProbeTestResult:)

##### Deprecated

- `startEchoTest`
- `setVideoQualityParameters`

##### Miscellaneous

v2.4.0 changes the type of the [`frameRate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html#//api/name/frameRate) parameter in the [`AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html) class from `enum` to `int`.

**v2.3.3**
v2.3.3 is released on January 24, 2019. 

#### Issues Fixed

Occasional inaccurate statistics returned in the `networkQuality` callback.

**v2.3.2**

v2.3.2 is released on January 16, 2019. 

#### Compatibility changes

Besides the new features and improvements mentioned below, it is worth noting that v2.3.2:

- Improves the SDK's ability to counter packet loss under unreliable network conditions.
- Improves the communication smoothness.
- Reduces video freezes in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile.

Before upgrading your SDK, ensure that the version is:

- Native SDK v1.11 or later.
- Web SDK v2.1 or later.

#### **New Features**

##### 1. Automatic exposure at a point of interest
v2.3.2 adds the following methods and callback to support camera exposure and improve the captured video quality:

- [`isCameraExposurePositionSupported`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/isCameraExposurePositionSupported): Checks whether the device supports camera exposure.
- [`setCameraExposurePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setCameraExposurePosition:): Sets the camera exposure position.
- [`cameraExposureDidChangedToRect`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:cameraExposureDidChangedToRect:): Occurs when the camera exposure area changes.
You can send the touch point coordinates in the view to the SDK for automatic exposure.

##### 2. Video quality in the interactive live streaming

v2.3.2 adds the [`minBitrate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration.html#//api/name/minBitrate) parameter (minimum encoding bitrate) in the [`setVideoEncoderConfiguration`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setVideoEncoderConfiguration:) method. The SDK automatically adjusts the encoding bitrate to adapt to the network conditions. Using a value greater than the default value forces the video encoder to output high-quality images but may cause more packet loss and hence sacrifice the smoothness of the video transmission. Agora does not recommend changing this value unless you have special requirements for image quality.

##### 3. Independent audio mixing volume adjustments for local playback and remote publishing

v2.3.2 adds the [`adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume:) and [`adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume:) methods to complement the [`adjustAudioMixingVolume`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustAudioMixingVolume:) method, allowing you to independently adjust the audio mixing volume for local playback and remote publishing.

This release also changes the behavior of the [adjustPlaybackSignalVolume](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/adjustPlaybackSignalVolume:) method to control only the voice volume. Therefore, to mute the local audio playback, call both the `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(0)` and `adjustAudioMixingVolume(0)` methods.

See [Adjust the Volume](../basic-features/adjust-volume) for the scenarios and corresponding APIs.

#### **Improvements**

##### 1. Improves the accuracy of the call quality statistics

v2.3.2 deprecates the `audioQualityOfUid` callback and replaces it with the `remoteAudioStats` callback to improve the accuracy of the call quality statistics. The `remoteAudioStats` callback returns parameters such as the audio frame loss rate, end-to-end audio delay, and jitter buffer delay at the receiver, which are more closely linked to the real user experience. In addition, v2.3.2 optimizes the algorithm of the `networkQuality` callback for the uplink and downlink network qualities.

- [`remoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStats:): Reports the statistics of the remote audio stream from each user/host. This callback replaces the onAudioQuality callback. 
- [`networkQuality`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:networkQuality:txQuality:rxQuality:): Reports the last mile network quality of each user in the channel.

Agora plans to improve the following callback in subsequent versions:

- [`lastmileQuality`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:lastmileQuality:): Reports the last mile network quality of the local user before the user joins a channel.

For the list of API methods related to the call quality statistics and on how and when to use them, see [Report In-call Statistics](../advanced-features/in-call-quality).

##### 2. New network connection policy

v2.3.2 adds the following API method and callback to get the current network connection state and reason for a connection state change:

- [`getConnectionState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/getConnectionState): Gets the connection state of the SDK.
- [`connectionChangedToState`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:connectionChangedToState:reason:): Occurs when the connection state of the SDK to the server changes.

v2.3.2 deprecates the [`rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted:) and [`rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned:) callbacks.

In the new API method, the network connection states are "disconnected", "connecting", "connected", "reconnecting", and "failed". The SDK triggers the `connectionChangedToState` callback when the network connection state changes. The SDK also triggers the `rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted` and `rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned` callbacks under certain circumstances, but Agora does not recommend using them.

##### 3. Improves the call rating system

v2.3.2 changes the rating parameter in the [`rate`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/rate:rating:description:) method to "1 to 5" to encourage more feedback from end-users on the quality of a call or interactive live streaming. Application developers can use this feedback for future product improvement. Agora strongly recommends integrating this method in your application.

##### 4. Improves the audio quality in music scenarios

v2.3.2 adds high-quality audio in scenarios such as music education. In the [`setAudioProfile`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setAudioProfile:scenario:) method, you can set [`AgoraAudioProfile`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioProfile.html) as MusicHighQuality(4) and [`AgoraAudioScenario`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Constants/AgoraAudioScenario.html) as GameStreaming(3) to minimize echo and noise while maintaining the quality of the music.

##### 5. Other improvements

- Minimizes packet loss under unreliable network conditions in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile.
- Accelerates the video quality recovery under network congestion.
- Improves the stability in pushing streams.
- Optimizes the API calling threads.
- Improves the performance of the SDK on mid-end and low-end iOS devices.
- Checks the headset and Bluetooth device connection.
- Reduces the audio delay.

#### **Issues Fixed**

The following issues are fixed in v2.3.2.

##### Audio

- A user joins the interactive live streaming with a Bluetooth headset. The audio is not played through the Bluetooth headset when the user leaves the channel and opens another application.
- Crashes when calling the `startAudioMixing` method to play music files.
- A previously disabled microphone becomes enabled when the device connects to a headset. 
- Cannot adjust the volume of the speaker when users change roles, join and leave channels, or a system phone or Siri interrupts.
- Users do not hear any voice for a while when an application switches back from the background. 

##### Video

- Occasional issues when using an external video source.
- The cursor on the remote side is not in the same position as the local side when sharing the desktop.

#### **API Changes**

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

##### Added

- [`isCameraExposurePositionSupported`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/isCameraExposurePositionSupported)
- [`setCameraExposurePosition`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setCameraExposurePosition:)

- [`remoteAudioStats`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:remoteAudioStats:)

##### Deprecated

- [`audioQualityOfUid`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:audioQualityOfUid:quality:delay:lost:)
- [`rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngineConnectionDidInterrupted:)
- [`rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/macos/3.x/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngineConnectionDidBanned:)

**v2.3.1**

v2.3.1 is released on September 28, 2018. 

#### **New Features**

##### Disables/Re-enables the Local Audio Function

When a user joins a channel, the audio function is enabled by default.
To receive audio streams without sending any audio streams after joining a channel, this version adds the `enableLocalAudio` method to disable or re-enable the local audio function.
Once the local audio function is disabled or re-enabled, the SDK returns the `didMicrophoneEnabled` callback, and the local audio capturing stops.
This method does not affect receiving or playing the remote audio streams.

The difference between this method and `muteLocalAudioStream` is that `enableLocalAudio` does not capture or send any audio stream, while `muteLocalAudioStream` captures but does not send audio streams.


#### **Improvements**

- Reduces the CPU consumption in the audio communication profile on some low-end iOS devices.


#### **Issues Fixed**

- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices when using customized video source functions.
- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices when using customized remote renderer functions.
- Occasional crashes when switching between the front and rear camera.
- `Communication` profile: If one user disables the video and re-enables it during a one-to-one call, it takes a long time for the other user to see the image.
- `LiveBroadcasting` profile: Occasionally, the app freezes and the user cannot leave the channel after switching between the front and rear cameras on some iOS devices.
- `LiveBroadcasting`: Occasionally, two taps are needed for a successful focus on some iOS devices.
- `LiveBroadcasting`: Delay at the client due to incorrect statistics.
- The timestamp in the captured raw video frames does not refresh with the frame.

**v2.3.0**

v2.3.0 is released on August 31, 2018.

#### **Compatibility changes**

-   To support video rotation and enable better quality for the custom video source, this version deprecates the `setVideoProfile` method and uses the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method instead to set the video encoding configurations. You can still use the `setVideoProfile` method but we recommend using the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to set the video profile because:
    -   During the interactive live streaming, users can set the video orientation mode as adaptive, under which the SDK can transfer rotated video frames without cropping them, thus avoiding the “big headshot” or blurry images at the player.
    -   In scenarios involving external video sources, the SDK adjusts the width and height of the output video frames based on the inputting video frames, avoiding unnecessary cropping and thereby rendering more image frames at the player.
-   An `Accelerate.framework` library is added to the SDK in v2.3.0, which is capable of large-scale mathematical computations and image calculations, optimized for high performance.
-   The security keys are improved and updated in v2.1.0.


#### **New Features**

##### 1. Fallback options for the interactive live streaming under unreliable network conditions.

The audio and video quality of the interactive live streaming deteriorate under unreliable network conditions. To improve the efficiency of the interactive live streaming, the `setLocalPublishFallbackOption` and `setRemoteSubscribFallbackOption` methods are added. These methods allow the SDK to automatically disable the video stream when the network conditions cannot support both audio and video, and enable the video when the network conditions improve. The SDK triggers the `didLocalPublishFallbackToAudioOnly` or `didRemoteSubscribeFallbackToAudioOnly` callback when the stream falls back to audio-only or when the stream switches back to the video.

##### 2. Notifies the user that the token expires in 30 seconds.

The SDK returns the `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire` callback 30 seconds before a token expires to notify the app to renew it. When this callback is received, you need to generate a new token on your server and call the `renewToken` method to pass the newly-generated token to the SDK.

##### 3. Returns user-specific upstream and downstream statistics, including the bitrate, frame rate, packet loss rate, and time delay

The `audioTransportStatsOfUid` and `videoTransportStatsOfUid` callbacks are added to provide user-specific upstream and downstream statistics, including the bitrate, frame rate, and packet loss rate. During a call or interactive live streaming, the SDK triggers these callbacks once every two seconds after the local user receives audio/video packets from a remote user. The callbacks include the user ID, audio bitrate at the receiver, packet loss rate, and time delay (ms).

##### 4. Sets the SDK’s control over an audio session

The SDK and app both have control over the audio session. However, the app may restrict the SDK’s control over an audio session and allow another app or a third-party component to control it by using the `setAudioSessionOperationRestriction` method. You can implement different levels of control by choosing the corresponding restriction. You can call this method before or after joining the channel.

##### 5. Sets the video encoder configurations

To support scenarios with video rotation and enable better quality for the custom video source, this release deprecates the `setVideoProfile` method and uses the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method instead to set the video encoding configurations. You can still use the `setVideoProfile` method but Agora recommends using the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to set the video profile because:

-   During the interactive live streaming, users can set the video orientation mode as adaptive, under which the SDK can transfer rotated video frames without cropping them, thus avoiding the “big headshot” or blurry images at the player.
-   In scenarios involving external video sources, the SDK adjusts the width and height of the output video frames based on the inputting video frames, avoiding unnecessary cropping and thereby rendering more image frames at the player.

The <code>AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration</code> class provides a set of configurable video parameters, including the dimension, frame rate, bitrate, and orientation. For more information on the API, see `Set the Video Encoder Configuration`.

##### 6. Adds support for background image settings in setLiveTranscoding

The `backgroundImage` parameter is added to the `setLiveTranscoding` method allowing you to set the background image in the combined video of the interactive live streaming.

#### **Improvements**

-   Improves the quality for one-on-one voice/video scenarios with optimized latency and smoothness, especially for areas like Southeast Asia, South America, Africa, and the Middle East.
-   Improves the audio encoder efficiency in the interactive live streaming to reduce user traffic while ensuring the call quality.
-   Improves the audio quality during a call or the interactive live streaming using the deep-learning algorithm.


#### **Issues Fixed**

- The users on the Web client cannot see the video sent from the Native client due to codec bugs.
- Excessive increase in the memory usage when multiple delegated hosts start streaming in the channel.
- Occasional video renderer crashes when the app switches to the background on some iOS devices.
- Occasional app crashes on some iOS devices.
- The remote view does not display on some devices.
- Occasional black screens on some iOS devices.
- Occasional ghost images.

- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices.
- Crashes when a user frequently mutes and resumes all sound effects on some iOS devices.
- Excessive increase in the memory usage for the host when the host frequently joins and leaves a channel that has multiple delegated hosts.
- Occasionally, the remote user cannot hear the host when the host switches between `Audience` and `Broadcaster`.
- Occasionally, the settings applied to the background image in live transcoding do not take effect.
- Occasionally on some devices, the video height and width are swapped in the `Communication` profile.
- Occasionally, the `destroy` method does not respond after a user enables the video and joins a channel.
- Occasionally on some iOS devices, a user fails to hear any sound after returning to the channel from a system phone call.
- Occasionally, the audience cannot adjust the channel volume.
- Occasional crashes when a user frequently joins and leaves the channel.
- Occasional crashes when you frequently set the video encoder profile on some iOS devices.
- Occasionally on iOS devices, a remote user cannot send video in a communication channel.
- Occasional failures to capture video of the delegated host when the hosts and the audience frequently change roles.
- Occasionally on some iOS devices, a web user can subscribe to the low-stream video even when the iOS device does not have the dual-stream mode enabled.
- Occasional crashes when calling the `setCameraFocusPositionInPreview` method on some devices.
- Occasional crashes when one of the two hosts mutes or disables the local audio while playing the background music.
- Occasional crashes on the iOS device when the device interoperates with the Web and when a web user frequently joins and leaves a channel.
- A user cannot join a communication channel after frequently changing the video encoder profiles.
- Occasional crashes on some devices when preloading the sound effects.

- Incorrect video orientation on some iOS devices when setting the video profile of an external video source during the interactive live streaming.
- On iOS, the bitrates cannot reach the target values when manually setting the video profile.
- Occasional inter-operational failures between an iOS and a macOS device.
- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices when a user leaves the interactive streaming channel while playing music using a third-party application.
- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices when leaving the channel.
- On iOS, when a host injects a stream to an interactive streaming channel, other hosts can still inject a second stream to the channel.
- Occasional crashes on some iOS devices when the user frequently turns on and off the camera.
- Occasional video freezes when switching from multiple hosts to a single host.
- Occasional inter-operational failures between SIP devices and the SDK.
- Occasional echo issues when using a specific audio card.
- Occasional video delays on some iOS devices.
- The video window size jumps from small to big on some iOS devices.
- Image blurs on some iOS devices when the camera vibrates.
- Failure to adjust the volume on some iOS devices.


#### **API Changes**

To improve your experience, we made the following changes to the APIs:

To avoid adding too many users with the same uid into the RTMP publishing channel, the following API methods are added in v2.3.0:

-   `addUser`
-   `removeUser`


The following API methods are deleted and no longer supported in v2.3.0. Agora provides the Recording SDK for better recording services. 

-   <code>startRecordingService</code>

**v2.2.0**

v2.2.0 is released on May 4, 2018. 


#### **New Features**

##### 1. Play the audio effect in the channel

Adds a <code>publish</code> parameter in the <code>playEffect</code> method for the remote user in the channel to hear the audio effect played locally. 
>  If your SDK is upgraded to v2.2 from a previous version, pay attention to the functional changes of this API.

##### 2. Deploy the proxy at the server

We provide a proxy package for enterprise users with corporate firewalls to deploy before accessing our services. 
##### 3. Get the remote video state

Adds the <code>remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid</code> method to get the state of the remote video stream. 

##### 4. Add watermarks on the interactive video streaming

Adds the watermark function for users to add a PNG file to the local or Media Push as a watermark. Adds the <code>addVideoWatermark</code> and <code>clearVideoWatermarks</code> methods to add and delete watermarks in the interactive live streaming. Adds the <code>watermark</code> parameter in the <code>LiveTranscording</code> interface to add watermarks in Media Push. 

#### **Improvements**

##### 1. Audio volume indication

Improves the <code>enableAudioVolumeIndication</code> method. This method once enabled, sends the audio volume indication of the speaker in its callback at set intervals, regardless of whether anyone is speaking in the channel.

##### 2. Network quality detection during a session

To meet the customers’ need for real-time network quality detection in the channel, the <code>onNetworkQuality</code> method improves its data accuracy. 

##### 3. Last mile network quality detection before joining a channel

To test if the customers’ network condition can support audio or video calls before joining the channel, the <code>onLastmileQuality</code> callback changes its detection base from a fixed bitrate to the bitrate set by the customer in <code>videoProfile</code> to improve data accuracy. When the network condition is unknown, the SDK triggers this callback once every 2 seconds. 

##### 4. Audio quality enhancement

Improves the audio quality in scenarios that involve music playback. To achieve high-fidelity music playback, you can set <code>Scenario：AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming = 3</code> in the <code>setAudioProfile</code> method. 

##### 5. Bitcode support

Adds support for Bitcode, which enables App optimization and thinning by the App Store. The package size of the Bitcode SDK is 2.5 times that of the normal one.

#### **Issues Fixed**

- Occasional screen display abnormalities when the iOS device sets its video in the landscape mode.
- Occasional screen display abnormalities when a large number of audience members join as the host in the interactive streaming channel.
- Fixed occasional echo issues caused by some iOS device.


**v2.1.3**

v2.1.3 is released on April 19, 2018.

In v2.1.3, Agora updates the bitrate values of the <code>setVideoProfile</code> method in the `LiveBroadcasting` profile. The bitrate values in v2.1.3 stay consistent with those in v2.0. 

#### **Issues Fixed**

-   Block callbacks are occasionally not received if the delegate is not set.
-   NSAssertionHandler appears in external links to the SDK.
-   Occasional recording failures on some phones when a user leaves a channel and turns on the built-in recording device.
-   `LiveBroadcasting` profile: The iOS client cannot see the video from the web client in Windows 10 even after iOS calls the <code>enableWebSdkInteroperability</code> method.
-   Occasional resolution changes after `UIImagePickerController` is used to enable the system camera and switch back to the `LiveBroadcasting` profile.
-   Occasional crashes during a `Communication` or `LiveBroadcasting` session.


#### **Improvements**

Improves the performance of screen sharing by shortening the time interval between which users switch from screen sharing to the normal `Communication` or `LiveBroadcasting` profile.

**v2.1.2**

v2.1.2 is released on April 2, 2018. 

>  If you upgrade the SDK to v2.1.2 from a previous version, the interactive video streaming quality is better than the communication video quality in the same resolutions, resulting in the interactive live video streaming using more bandwidth. 

#### **New Features**

Extends the <code>setVideoProfile</code> method to enable users to manually set the resolution, frame rate, and bitrate of the video. 

#### **Issues Fixed**

-   Occasional crashes on iOS 11.
-   Video freeze in DTX + AAC mode.


**v2.1.1**

**v2.1.0**

v2.1.0 is released on March 7, 2018. 

#### **New Features**

##### 1. Voice Optimization

Adds a scenario for the game chat room to reduce the bandwidth and cancel the noise with the <code>setAudioProfile</code> method.

##### 2. Enhance the audio effect input from the built-in microphone

In an interactive streaming, the host can enhance the local audio effects from the built-in microphone with the <code>setLocalVoiceEqualization</code> and <code>setLocalVoiceReverb</code> methods by implementing the voice equalization and reverberation effects.

##### 3. Online statistics query

Adds RESTful APIs to check the status of the users in the channel, the channel list of a specific company, and whether the user is an audience or a host. For detailed information, see [RESTful API](dashboard_restful_communication).

##### 4. 17-way video

Adds the support of 17-way video in interactive streaming.

##### 5. Video source customization

Supports the default video-capturing features provided by the camera and the customized video source. 

##### 6. Renderer customization

Supports the default functions provided by the renderers to display the local and remote videos to meet your requirements. We provide a set of interfaces for customized renderers. 

##### 7. Injecting an external video stream

Adds the function of injecting an external video stream to an ongoing interactive live streaming.

##### 8. Camera focus change

Adds a <code>cameraFocusDidChanged</code> callback to report to the app when the camera focus area changes.

#### **Improvement**

|     Improvement   |     Description     |
|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|
|Video Freeze Rate|Reduces the video freeze rate in the audience mode and for specific devices.|
|Authentication|Supports a new authentication mechanism. Each legacy Dynamic Key (Channel Key) corresponds to a single privilege (for example, joining a channel), but each token in the new authentication mechanism includes all privileges (for example, joining a channel, hosting in, and stream-pushing).|
|Billing Optimization|Small video resolutions are charged according to the voice-only mode. For example, 16 &times; 16.|
|API Naming Optimization|Modifies a set of names for the API attributes and enumeration values.|



#### **Issues Fixed**

- Occasional crashes.

#### Issues Fixed

Audio routing and Bluetooth issues.

**v1.14**

v1.14 is released on October 20, 2017. 

#### New Features

-   Adds the <code>setAudioProfile</code> method to set the audio parameters and scenarios.
-   Adds the <code>setLocalVoicePitch</code> method to set the local voice pitch.
-   `LiveBroadcasting`: Adds the <code>setInEarMonitoringVolume</code> method to adjust the volume of the in-ear monitor.


#### Improvements

-   Optimizes the audio at high bitrates.
-   `LiveBroadcasting`: The audience can view the host within one second in a single-stream mode (938 ms on average, and 734 ms under good network conditions).
-   Adds the ability to reduce the bandwidth.
    -   Before v1.14: If you muted the audio of a specific user, the network still sent the stream.
    -   Starting from v1.14: If you mute the audio of a specific user, the network will not send the stream of the user to reduce the bandwidth.
-   Accurate control over the bitrate:
    -   Before v1.14: Inaccurate control over the bitrate often caused huge fluctuations, leading to network congestion and higher rates of packet and frame loss. This affected the accuracy of the bandwidth estimation module, especially when the network was under poor conditions.
    -   Starting from v1.14: Accurate control over the bitrate prevents huge fluctuations avoiding network congestion and shortening the transmission latency.


#### Issues Fixed:

Occasional crashes on iOS devices.
