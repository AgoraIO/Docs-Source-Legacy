## Introduction

To meet the laws and regulations of different countries or regions, the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> supports geofencing. After enabling geofencing, the Agora SDK only connects to Agora servers within the specified region.

For example, if you specify North America as the region for connection, the SDK only connects to Agora servers in North America. When there is no available server in North American, the SDK throws an error instead of connecting to servers in another region.

<div class="alert note">Do not enable geofencing if your scenarios do not have regional restrictions.</div>

## Implementation

By default, the SDK connects to nearby Agora servers. As of v3.1.2, the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> Web SDK supports geofencing. You can specify the region for connection when creating a client instance by calling [`createClient`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/web/3.x/globals.html#createclient). Choose either of the following ways to specify the region for connection:
- Set the `areaCode` parameter in `ClientConfig` to specify only one region for connection.
- Set the `areaCode` parameter to specify a large region and the `excludedArea` parameter to specify a small region. The region for connection is the large region excluding the small region. You can only specify the large region as `GLOBAL`.

After specifying the region, the SDK connects to the Agora servers within that region.

The supported `areaCode` include:

- `ASIA`: Asia, excluding Mainland China
- `CHINA`: Mainland China
- `EUROPE`: Europe
- `GLOBAL`: Global
- `INDIA`: India
- `JAPAN`: Japan
- `NORTH_AMERICA`: North America

<div class="alert note">
The setting of the geofencing is global, which takes effect for the entire tab page. That is, as long as one client has set geofencing, other clients created on the same page comply with the same setting.
	</div>

## Sample code

```javascript
var config = {
    mode: "live",
    codec: "vp8",
		// Specify the region for connection as North America
    areaCode: [AgoraRTC.AREAS.NORTH_AMERICA]
};

var client = AgoraRTC.createClient(config);
```

```javascript
var config = {
    mode: "live",
    codec: "vp8",
		// // Exclude Mainland China from the regions for connection
    areaCode: [AgoraRTC.AREAS.GLOBAL]ï¼Œ
    excludedArea: AgoraRTC.AREAS.CHINA
};

var client = AgoraRTC.createClient(config);
```

## Considerations

If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you whitelist certain domains, allow all IP addresses, and open certain firewall ports according to [Firewall Requirements](../reference/firewall).
