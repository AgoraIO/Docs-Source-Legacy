## Introduction

**After joining the channel**, the SDK triggers the following callbacks related to the call quality **once every two seconds**. You can see the last mile network quality, local statistics, audio quality, and video quality of the current call.

<div class="alert note">Ensure that you implement a video call or interactive video streaming in your project. For details, see the following documents:
  <li>iOS: <a href="/3.x/video-calling/quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk">Start a Call</a> or <a href="../quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming">Start Live Interactive Streaming</a></li>
  <li>macOS: <a href="/3.x/video-calling/quickstart-guide/get-started-sdk">Start a Call</a> or <a href="../quickstart-guide/start-video-streaming">Start Live Interactive Streaming</a></li></div>

## Sample project

Agora provides an open-source sample project on GitHub that implements the in-call statistics monitoring function. You can download the sample project to try it out or view the source code:

- iOS: [JoinChannelVideo.swift](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/blob/legacy/iOS/APIExample/Examples/Basic/JoinChannelVideo/JoinChannelVideo.swift)
- macOS: [JoinChannelVideo.swift](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/blob/legacy/macOS/APIExample/Examples/Basic/JoinChannelVideo/JoinChannelVideo.swift)


## Network quality report

The `networkQuality` callback reports the uplink and downlink last mile network quality of each user/host in the current call, see [Quality Rating](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//namespaceagora_1_1rtc.html#aeaf419fcafaa4d58da8b6d8718e31891) for details.
Last mile refers to the network from your device to Agora’s edge server. The uplink last mile quality rating is based on the actual transmission bitrate, the uplink network packet loss rate, the average round-trip delay, and the uplink network jitter; while the downlink last mile quality rating is based on the downlink network packet loss rate, the average round-trip delay, and the downlink network jitter.

>- In the <code>Communication</code> profile, you receive network quality reports of all the users (including yours) in the channel once every two seconds.
> - In the `LiveBroadcasting` profile, if you are the host, you receive network quality reports of all hosts (including yours) in the channel once every two seconds; if you are the audience, you receive the report of all hosts and yourself once every two seconds.
> - The higher the ratio of the actual transmission bitrate to the target transmission bitrate, the better the call quality and the higher the network quality.
> - <a name="RTT"></a>**The average round-trip delay** refers to the average value of multiple round-trip delays in the reported interval.

## Statistics report

The `reportRtcStats` callback reports call statistics. You can see the duration, the number of users in the channel, the system CPU usage, the application CPU usage, and the following parameters of the current call.

```swift
func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, reportRtcStats stats: AgoraChannelStats) {
    videos[0].statsInfo?.updateChannelStats(stats)
}
```

## Audio quality report

### Statistics of local audio streams

The `localAudioStats` callback reports the statistics of the audio streams sent. You can see the number of channels (mono or dual), the sample rate, and the **average** sending bitrate in the reported interval.

>The SDK triggers this callback once every two seconds. The sample rate refers to the actual sample rate of the audio streams sent in the reported interval.

#### Sample code

```swift
func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, localAudioStats stats: AgoraRtcLocalAudioStats) {
    videos[0].statsInfo?.updateLocalAudioStats(stats)
}
```

<a name="32"></a>
### State changes of local audio streams

When the state of the local audio stream changes (including the state of the audio recording and encoding), the SDK triggers the `localAudioStateChange` callback to report the current state. You can troubleshoot with the error code when exceptions occur.

### Statistics of remote audio streams

![1565945275984](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1565945275984)

The `remoteAudioStats` callback reports the audio statistics of each remote user/host in the current call. You can see the quality of the audio stream sent by each remote user/host (see [Quality Rating](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//namespaceagora_1_1rtc.html#aeaf419fcafaa4d58da8b6d8718e31891)), the number of channels (mono or dual), and the following parameters.

| Parameter               | Description                                                  | Comment                                                      |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `networkTransportDelay` | The network delay from the sender to the receiver.           | Stages 2 + 3 + 4 in the figure above                         |
| `jitterBufferDelay`     | The network delay from the receiver to the network jitter buffer. | Stage 5 in the figure above                                  |
| `audioLossRate`         | The frame loss rate of the received remote audio streams in the reported interval. | <li>Stages 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 in the figure above</li><li>In a reported interval, audio **freeze** occurs when the audio frame loss rate reaches 4%.</li> |
| `receivedSampleRate`    | The sample rate of the received remote audio streams in the reported interval. |                                                              |
| `receivedBitrate`       | The **average** bitrate of the received remote audio streams in the reported interval. |                                                              |
| `totalFrozenTime`       | The total **freeze** time (ms) of the remote audio streams after the remote user joins the channel. | <li>Agora defines `totalFrozenTime` = The number of times the audio freezes × 2 × 1000 (ms).</li><li>The total time is the cumulative duration after the remote user joins the channel.</li> |
| `frozenRate`            | The total audio freeze time is a percentage of the total time when the audio is available. | When the remote user/host neither stops sending the audio stream nordisables the audio module after joining the channel, the audio is **available**. |
| `qoeQuality`     |   Quality of experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream.    |                                |
| `qualityChangedReason`     |   The reason for poor QoE of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream.       |                                |
| `mosValue`     |   The quality of the remote audio stream as determined by the Agora real-time audio MOS (Mean Opinion Score) measurement system in the reported interval.      |                                |

The `remoteAudioStats` callback reports statistics more closely linked to the real-user experience of the audio transmission quality. Even if network packet loss occurs, users may find the overall audio quality acceptable because the audio frame loss rate of the received audio streams may not be high due to the **anti-packet-loss** and congestion control methods, such as forward error correction (FEC), retransmissions and bandwidth estimation.


> - In the <code>Communication</code> profile, you receive the audio stream statistics of all the remote users (excluding yours) in the channel once every two seconds.
> - In the `LiveBroadcasting` profile, if you are the host, you receive the audio stream statistics of all remote hosts (excluding yours) in the channel once every two seconds; if you are the audience, you receive the statistics of all hosts in the channel once every two seconds.
> - Agora's **audio module** refers to the audio processing process, and not the actual module in the SDK. When sending audio streams, the audio module refers to the processes of audio sampling, pre-processing, and encoding; when receiving audio streams, the audio module refers to the processes of audio decoding, post-processing, and playback.
> - Users can only turn on/off their own audio modules.
> - By default, the audio freezes at most once in each reported interval.

#### Sample code

```swift
func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, remoteAudioStats stats: AgoraRtcRemoteAudioStats) {
    videos.first(where: { $0.uid == stats.uid })?.statsInfo?.updateAudioStats(stats)
}
```

### State changes of remote audio streams

When the state of **remote** audio stream changes, the SDK triggers the `remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid` callback to report the current state and the reason for the state change.

> - In the <code>Communication</code> profile, this callback reports to you the audio stream state information of all the remote users (excluding yours) in the channel once every two seconds.
> - In the `LiveBroadcasting` profile, if you are the host, this callback reports to you the audio stream state information of all the remote hosts(excluding yours) in the channel once every two seconds; if you are the audience, this callback reports to you the audio stream state information of all the remote hosts in the channel once every two seconds.
