Use this guide to quickly start the interactive live video streaming with the Agora Video SDK for Windows.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Interactive Live Streaming Premium functionality.

![1625465916613](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625465916613)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Interactive Live Streaming Premium in your project is as follows:

1. Set the client role
Each user in an Interactive Live Streaming Premium channel is either a host or an audience member. Hosts publish streams to the channel, and the audience subscribe to the streams.

2. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

3. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

4. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, app clients with the role of the host can publish audio and video. For an auidence memeber to send audio and video, you can call `setClientRole` to switch the client role.

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the live stream.

## Sample projects

## Implement the basic interactive live streaming
This section introduces how to use the Agora SDK to start the interactive live video streaming. The following figure shows the API call sequence of the interactive live video streaming.

![1617354558421](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1617354558421)

### 1. Create the UI
Create the user interface (UI) for the interactive video streaming in your project. Skip to [Initialize IRtcEngine](#ini) if you already have a UI in your project.

If you are implementing the interactive video streaming, we recommend adding the following elements into the UI:
- The view of the host
- The exit button

When you use the UI setting of the sample project, you can see the following interface:

![1568792708592](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1568792708592)

<a name="ini"></a>
### 2. Initialize IRtcEngine
Create and initialize the `IRtcEngine` object before calling any other Agora APIs.

In this step, you need to use the App ID of your project. Refer to [Get Started With Agora](../reference/manage-agora-account) to create an Agora project and get the App ID in Console.

Call the `createAgoraRtcEngine` method and the `initialize` method, and pass in the App ID to initialize the `IRtcEngine` object.

You can also listen for callback events, such as when the local user joins or leaves the channel.

```cpp
// Create the instance.
m_lpAgoraEngine = createAgoraRtcEngine();
RtcEngineContext ctx;

// Add the register events and callbacks.
ctx.eventHandler = &m_engineEventHandler;

// Input your App ID.
ctx.appId = "YourAppID";

// Initialize the IRtcEngine object.
m_lpAgoraEngine->initialize(ctx);
```

```cpp
// Inherit the events and callbacks of IRtcEngineEventHandler.
class CAGEngineEventHandler :
    public IRtcEngineEventHandler
{
public:
    CAGEngineEventHandler();
    ~CAGEngineEventHandler();
    void setMainWnd(HWND wnd);
    HWND GetMsgReceiver() {return m_hMainWnd;};

    // Listen for the onJoinChannelSuccess callback.
    // This callback occurs when the local user successfully joins the channel.
    virtual void onJoinChannelSuccess(const char* channel, uid_t uid, int elapsed);

    // Listen for the onLeaveChannel callback.
    // This callback occurs when the local user successfully leaves the channel.
    virtual void onLeaveChannel(const RtcStats& stat);

    // Listen for the onUserJoined callback.
    // This callback occurs when the remote host successfully joins the channel.
    // After receiving this callback, immediately call setupRemoteVideo to set the remote video view.
    virtual void onUserJoined(uid_t uid, int elapsed) override;

    // Listen for the onUserOffline callback.
    // This callback occurs when the remote host leaves the channel or drops offline.
    virtual void onUserOffline(uid_t uid, USER_OFFLINE_REASON_TYPE reason);
private:
    HWND m_hMainWnd;
};
```

### 3. Set the channel profile
After initializing the `IRtcEngine` object, call the `setChannelProfile` method to set the channel profile as `LIVE_BROADCASTING`.

One `IRtcEngine` object uses one profile only. If you want to switch to another profile, release the current `IRtcEngine` object with the `release` method and create a new one before calling the `setChannelProfile` method.

```cpp
m_lpAgoraEngine->setChannelProfile(CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING);
```

### 4. Set the client role
A `LIVE_BROADCASTING` channel has two client roles: `BROADCASTER` and `AUDIENCE`, and the default role is `AUDIENCE`. After setting the channel profile to `LIVE_BROADCASTING`, your app may use the following steps to set the client role:
- 1. Allow the user to set the role as `BROADCASTER` or `AUDIENCE`.
- 2. Call the `setClientRole` method and pass in the client role set by the user.

Note that in the interactive live streaming, only the host can be heard and seen. If you want to switch the client role after joining the channel, call the `setClientRole` method.

```cpp
// Set the client role.
BOOL CAgoraObject::SetClientRole(CLIENT_ROLE_TYPE role, LPCSTR lpPermissionKey)
{
    int nRet = m_lpAgoraEngine->setClientRole(role);
    m_nRoleType = role;
    return nRet == 0 ? TRUE : FALSE;
}
```

```cpp
// Show a dialog box to choose a user role.
void CEnterChannelDlg::OnCbnSelchangeCmbRole()
{
    int nSel = m_ctrRole.GetCurSel();
    if (nSel == 0)
        CAgoraObject::GetAgoraObject()->SetClientRole(CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER);
    else
        CAgoraObject::GetAgoraObject()->SetClientRole(CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE);
}
```

### 5. Set the local video view
After setting the channel profile and client role, set the local video view before joining the channel so that the host can see the local video in the interactive streaming. Follow these steps to configure the local video view:
- Call the `enableVideo` method to enable the video module.
- Call the `setupLocalVideo` method to configure the local video display settings.

```cpp
// Enable the video module.
m_lpAgoraEngine->enableVideo();

// Set the local video view.
VideoCanvas vc;
vc.uid = 0;
vc.view = hVideoWnd;
vc.renderMode = RENDER_MODE_TYPE::RENDER_MODE_HIDDEN;
m_lpAgoraEngine->setupLocalVideo(vc);
```

<a name="join"></a>
### 6. Join a channel
After setting the client role and the local video view, you can call the `joinChannel` method to join a channel. In this method, set the following parameters:

- `channelName`: Specify the channel name that you want to join.

* `token`: Pass a token that identifies the role and privilege of the user.  You can set it as one of the following values:
  * A temporary token generated in Console. A temporary token is valid for 24 hours. For details, see [Get a Temporary Token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token). When joining a channel, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you use to generate the temporary token.
  * A token generated at the server. This applies to scenarios with high-security requirements. For details, see [Generate a token from Your Server](../basic-features/token-server). When joining a channel, ensure that the channel name and `uid` is the same with those you use to generate the token.

 <div class="alert note"><ul><li>If your project has enabled the app certificate, ensure that you provide a token.</li><li>Ensure that you do not set <code>token</code> as "".</li></ul></div>

- `uid`: ID of the local user that is an integer and should be unique. If you set `uid` as 0,  the SDK assigns a user ID for the local user and returns it in the `onJoinChannelSuccess` callback.
  <div class="alert note">Once the user joins the channel, the user subscribes to the audio and video streams of all the other users in the channel by default, giving rise to usage and billing calculation. If you do not want to subscribe to a specified stream or all remote streams, call the <code>mute</code> methods accordingly.</div>

For more details on the parameter settings, see [joinChannel](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/3.x//classagora_1_1rtc_1_1_i_rtc_engine.html#adc937172e59bd2695ea171553a88188c).

```cpp
// Join a channel with a token.
BOOL CAgoraObject::JoinChannel(LPCTSTR lpChannelName, UINT nUID, LPCSTR lpDynamicKey)
{
    int nRet = 0;
    LPCSTR lpStreamInfo = "{\"owner\":true,\"width\":640,\"height\":480,\"bitrate\":500}";
#ifdef UNICODE
    CHAR szChannelName[128];
    ::WideCharToMultiByte(CP_ACP, 0, lpChannelName, -1, szChannelName, 128, NULL, NULL);
    nRet = m_lpAgoraEngine->joinChannel(lpDynamicKey, szChannelName, lpStreamInfo, nUID);
#else
    nRet = m_lpAgoraEngine->joinChannel(lpDynamicKey, lpChannelName, lpStreamInfo, nUID);
#endif
    if (nRet == 0)
        m_strChannelName = lpChannelName;
    return nRet == 0 ? TRUE : FALSE;
}
```

### 7. Set the remote video view

In the interactive video streaming, you should also be able to see all the hosts, regardless of your role. This is achieved by calling the `setupRemoteVideo` method after joining the channel.

Shortly after a remote host joins the channel, the SDK gets the host's user ID in the `onUserJoined` callback. Call the `setupRemoteVideo` method in the callback and pass in the `uid` to set the video view of the host.


```cpp
// Listen for the onUserJoined callback.
// After receiving this callback, immediately call setupRemoteVideo to set the remote video view.
void CAGEngineEventHandler::onUserJoined(uid_t uid, int elapsed)
{
	LPAGE_USER_JOINED lpData = new AGE_USER_JOINED;

	lpData->uid = uid;
	lpData->elapsed = elapsed;

	if(m_hMainWnd != NULL)
		::PostMessage(m_hMainWnd, WM_MSGID(EID_USER_JOINED), (WPARAM)lpData, 0);
}
```

```cpp
VideoCanvas canvas;
canvas.renderMode = RENDER_MODE_FIT;
POSITION pos = m_listWndInfo.GetHeadPosition();
......
AGVIDEO_WNDINFO &agvWndInfo = m_listWndInfo.GetNext(pos);
canvas.uid = agvWndInfo.nUID;
canvas.view = m_wndVideo[nIndex].GetSafeHwnd();
agvWndInfo.nIndex = nIndex;

// Set the remote video view.
CAgoraObject::GetEngine()->setupRemoteVideo(canvas);
```

### 8. Leave the channel
Call the `leaveChannel` method to leave the current channel according to your scenario, for example, when the interactive streaming ends, when you need to close the app, or when your app runs in the background.

```cpp
BOOL CAgoraObject::LeaveCahnnel()
{
    m_lpAgoraEngine->stopPreview();
    // Leave the current channel.
    int nRet = m_lpAgoraEngine->leaveChannel();
    m_nSelfUID = 0;
    return nRet == 0 ? TRUE : FALSE;
}


void CAgoraObject::CloseAgoraObject()
{
    if(m_lpAgoraEngine != NULL)
        // Release the IRtcEngine object.
        m_lpAgoraEngine->release();
    if(m_lpAgoraObject != NULL)
        delete m_lpAgoraObject;
    m_lpAgoraEngine = NULL;
    m_lpAgoraObject = NULL;
}
```

## Run the project
Run the project on your Windows device. When you set the role as the host and successfully start the interactive video streaming, you can see the video view of yourself in the app. When you set the role as the audience and successfully join the interactive video streaming, you can see the video view of the host in the app.
