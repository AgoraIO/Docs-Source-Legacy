## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Interactive Live Streaming Premium functionality.

![1625465916613](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625465916613)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Interactive Live Streaming Premium in your project is as follows:

1. Set the client role
Each user in an Interactive Live Streaming Premium channel is either a host or an audience member. Hosts publish streams to the channel, and the audience subscribe to the streams.  

2. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

3. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

4. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, app clients with the role of the host can publish audio and video. For an auidence memeber to send audio and video, you can call `setClientRole` to switch the client role. 

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the live stream.

### Other prerequisites

A valid Agora [developer account](../reference/manage-agora-account#sign-up-and-log-in).

## Get App ID and token

### 1. Create an Agora project

To create an Agora project, do the following:

1. Enter the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check **Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)** as the authentication mechanism.
4. Click **Submit**. You can now see the project on the **Project Management** page.

### 2. Get an App ID

Agora automatically assigns each project an App ID as a unique identifier.

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532" />  icon in the App ID column.


### 3. Generate a temporary token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](../reference/glossary#token) to authenticate users joining a channel.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTC temporary tokens. To generate an RTC temporary token:
1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, find your project and click **Config**.
  ![1641971834422](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971834422) 
2. Click **Generate temp RTC token** under **Primary Certificate**.
  ![1641971893263](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971893263)
3. Enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click **Generate**. When joining the channel later, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you enter here.
 <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649997524064" />
4. Click the copy icon to copy the temporary token. 
 <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649997750496" />

<div class="alert note">Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only, and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. For details, see <a href="../basic-features/token-server">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</a>.</div>


## Create a Flutter Project

This article uses Visual Studio Code to create a Flutter project. Before you begin, you need to install the Flutter plugin in Visual Studio Code. See [Set up an editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode).

1. Launch Visual Studio Code. Select the **Flutter: New Project** command in **View > Command**. Enter the project name and press `<Enter>`.
2. Select the location of the project in the pop-up window. Visual Studio Code automatically generates a simple project.

## Add dependencies

Add the following dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:

1. Add the `agora_rtc_engine` dependency to integrate Agora Flutter SDK. See https://pub.dev/packages/agora_rtc_engine for the latest version of `agora_rtc_engine`.
2. Add the `permission_handler` dependency to add the permission handling function.

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter


  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.3
  # Please use the latest version of agora_rtc_engine
  agora_rtc_engine: ^5.2.0
  permission_handler: ^8.3.0
```

Because JCenter is about to retire, Agora publishes the RTC Android SDK package to JitPack instead of JCenter. Therefore, to build an Android application, add the following line in the `/android/build.gradle` file of your project:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

## Implement live video streaming

Open `main.dart`, remove all code after `void main() => runApp(MyApp());`.

<div class="alert note">If your first line is not <code>void main() => runApp(MyApp());</code>, replace it with <code>void main() => runApp(MyApp());</code> and remove all code after it.</div>

Refer to the following steps to add code to the file:

### 1: Import packages

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:agora_rtc_engine/rtc_engine.dart';
import 'package:agora_rtc_engine/rtc_local_view.dart' as RtcLocalView;
import 'package:agora_rtc_engine/rtc_remote_view.dart' as RtcRemoteView;
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';
```


### 2: Define App ID and Token

See [Set up Authentication](../basic-features/token-server).


```dart
/// Define App ID and Token
const APP_ID = '<Your App ID>';
const Token = '<Your Token>';
```

### 3: Define MyApp Class


```dart
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}
```

### 4: Define app states

```dart
// App state class
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  bool _joined = false;
  int _remoteUid = 0;
  bool _switch = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initPlatformState();
  }

  // Init the app
  Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
    if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android) {
           await [Permission.microphone, Permission.camera].request();
    }

    // Create RTC client instance
    RtcEngineContext context = RtcEngineContext(APP_ID);
    var engine = await RtcEngine.createWithContext(context);
    // Define event handling logic
    engine.setEventHandler(RtcEngineEventHandler(
        joinChannelSuccess: (String channel, int uid, int elapsed) {
          print('joinChannelSuccess ${channel} ${uid}');
          setState(() {
            _joined = true;
          });
        }, userJoined: (int uid, int elapsed) {
      print('userJoined ${uid}');
      setState(() {
        _remoteUid = uid;
      });
    }, userOffline: (int uid, UserOfflineReason reason) {
      print('userOffline ${uid}');
      setState(() {
        _remoteUid = 0;
      });
    }));
    // Enable video
    await engine.enableVideo();
	// Set channel profile as livestreaming
    await engine.setChannelProfile(ChannelProfile.LiveBroadcasting);
    // Set user role as broadcaster
    await engine.setClientRole(ClientRole.Broadcaster);
	// Join channel with channel name as 123
    await engine.joinChannel(Token, '123', null, 0);
  }


  // Build UI
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Flutter example app'),
        ),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            Center(
              child: _switch ? _renderRemoteVideo() : _renderLocalPreview(),
            ),
            Align(
              alignment: Alignment.topLeft,
              child: Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: GestureDetector(
                  onTap: () {
                    setState(() {
                      _switch = !_switch;
                    });
                  },
                  child: Center(
                    child:
                    _switch ? _renderLocalPreview() : _renderRemoteVideo(),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Local video rendering
  Widget _renderLocalPreview() {
    if (_joined && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android ||
            _joined && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS) {
      return RtcLocalView.SurfaceView();
    } 
    
    if (_joined && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.windows ||
            _joined && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.macOS) {
      return RtcLocalView.TextureView();
    } 

    else {
      return Text(
        'Please join channel first',
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
      );
    }
  }

  // Remote video rendering
  Widget _renderRemoteVideo() {
    if (_remoteUid != 0 && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android || _remoteUid != 0 && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS) {
      return RtcRemoteView.SurfaceView(
        uid: _remoteUid,
        channelId: "123",
      );
    } 
    
    if (_remoteUid != 0 && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.windows || _remoteUid != 0 && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.macOS) {
      return RtcRemoteView.TextureView(
        uid: _remoteUid,
        channelId: "123",
      );
    } 
    
    else {
      return Text(
        'Please wait remote user join',
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
      );
    }
  }
}
```
