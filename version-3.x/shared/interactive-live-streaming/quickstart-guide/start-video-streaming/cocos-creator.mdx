This article describes how to build a Cocos Creator project that implements the live video streaming function using the Agora Cocos Creator SDK.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Interactive Live Streaming Premium functionality.

![1625465916613](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625465916613)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Interactive Live Streaming Premium in your project is as follows:

1. Set the client role
Each user in an Interactive Live Streaming Premium channel is either a host or an audience member. Hosts publish streams to the channel, and the audience subscribe to the streams.

2. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

3. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

4. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, app clients with the role of the host can publish audio and video. For an auidence memeber to send audio and video, you can call `setClientRole` to switch the client role.

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the live stream.


## Prerequisites

## Create a Cocos Creator project

Use the following steps to build a project from scratch:

1. Open Cocos Creator, and navigate to **New Project**.
2. Choose an example (**Hello World** shown here), choose a storage path, and enter a project name.
3. Click **Create**.

## Integrate the SDK

1. Open a Cocos Creator project, and click **Service** on the right to open the **Service** panel.
2. Click the ![1603983326448](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1603983326448) button following **AppID**, and click **Set Cocos AppID**.
  ![1603983352672](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1603983352672)
3. Click the drop-down box, select a game, and click **Association** to associate your project with your game.
4. On the **Service** panel, scroll down to find and click **Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />**.
5. Click the ![1603983397604](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1603983397604) button following **Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />**, read the prompts carefully, and click **Open Service**.
6. On the bottom of the **Agora RTC** panel, select **Video** as the SDK type, and click **Save** to integrate the Agora Cocos Creator SDK. Then, in **Node Library** > **Cloud Nodes**, you can see **AgoraVideoRender**.

After integrating the Agora Cocos Creator SDK, Cocos Creator automatically adds codes in your project for obtaining device permissions, so you do not need to write these codes yourself.

Cocos Creator also uses your Cocos Creator account to automatically register an Agora account and create an Agora project. You can click **Dashboard** on the **Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />** panel to visit Agora Console.


## <a name="configure"></a>Configure the Agora project

### 1. Get an Agora App ID

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the copy icon in the App ID column.


### 2. Generate an Agora temporary token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](../reference/glossary#token) to authenticate users joining a channel.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTC temporary tokens. To generate an RTC temporary token:
1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, find your project and click **Config**.
  ![1641971834422](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971834422)
2. Click **Generate temp <Vg k="VSDK" /> token** under **Primary Certificate**.
  ![1641971893263](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641971893263)
3. Enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click **Generate**. When joining the channel later, ensure that the channel name is the same with the one you enter here.
 <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649997524064" />
4. Click the copy icon to copy the temporary token.
 <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649997750496" />

<div class="alert note">Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only, and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. For details, see <a href="../basic-features/token-server">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</a>.</div>


## Implementation

Once the project is set up, create a component script and a scene based on your requirements, and add the script into the scene node. See [Creating and using component script](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/scripting/).

You can use core APIs of the Agora Cocos Creator SDK in the `Script/HelloWorld.js` component script to implement the basic interactive live video streaming function. The following figure shows the API call sequence:

![1606314149803](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1606314149803)

### <a name="initialize"></a>1. Initialize the Agora engine

Initialize the Agora engine before calling any other Agora APIs. You need to pass in the Agora App ID obtained from the [Configure the Agora project](#configure) section.

Call `init` and pass in the App ID to initialize the Agora engine.

According to your requirements, you can also listen for callback events in this step, such as when the local user joins or leaves the channel.

```typescript
cc.Class({

    ...

    onLoad: function () {
        // Initialize the Agora engine. Replace YOUR_APPID with the App ID of your Agora project.
        agora.init('YOUR_APPID');
        agora.on('joinChannelSuccess', this.onJoinChannelSuccess, this);
        agora.on('leaveChannel', this.onLeaveChannel, this);
        agora.on('userJoined', this.onUserJoined, this);
        agora.on('userOffline', this.onUserOffline, this);
    },

    ...
});
```

### 2. Set the channel profile

After initializing the Agora engine, call `setChannelProfile` to set the channel profile as `LIVE_BROADCASTING`.

If you want to switch to another profile, destroy the current Agora engine with the `release` method, and reinitialize the Agora engine before calling `setChannelProfile`.

```typescript
cc.Class({

    ...

    onLoad: function () {

        ...

        // Set the channel profile as interactive live streaming.
        agora.setChannelProfile(agora.CHANNEL_PROFILE_TYPE.CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING);
    },

    ...
});
```

### 3. Set the client role

An interactive streaming channel has two client roles: `BROADCASTER` and `AUDIENCE`; the default role is `AUDIENCE`.

After setting the channel profile to `LIVE_BROADCASTING`, your app may use the following steps to set the client role:

1. In Cocos Creator, navigate to **Node Library** > **Builtin Nodes**, and add **Toggle Group** to the **Scene** panel. You can adjust the display position of toggle components as needed.

2. In the **Node Tree** panel, you can see that the **toggleContainer** contains three toggle components. You need to delete one redundant toggle, for example, **toggle3**.

   <div class="alert info">In this section, designate <b>toggle1</b> as the option for audience, and <b>toggle2</b> as the option for host.</div>

3. In `HelloWorld.js`, call `setClientRole`, and pass in the client role set by the user.

   ```typescript
   cc.Class({

       ...

       setClientRole: function (toggle, customEventData) {
           // Set the client role. A user chooses a client role and the toggle component passes it through customEventData.
           // If the customEventData value is 1, the client role is set to audience, and the corresponding enumerator is agora
           CLIENT_ROLE_TYPE.CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE.
           // If the customEventData value is 2, the client role is set to host, and the corresponding enumerator is agora.CLIENT_ROLE_TYPE
           CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER.
           agora.setClientRole(customEventData);
       },

       ...
   });
   ```

4. Return to Cocos Creator, and click **toggle1**. In the **Properties** panel, find **Toggle** > **Check Events**, and add a check event.

5. On the **Node Tree** panel, find and add the **Canvas** to the **cc.Node** property box of the check event. In the two drop-down boxes following the **cc.Node** property box, select the scene (**HelloWorld**) and the check event (**setClientRole**) in turn, and enter **1** in **CustomEventData**.
   ![1606314281987](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1606314281987)
6. Click **Add Component** > **Renderer Component** > **Label** to add a label for **toggle1**. navigate to **Label** > **String**, and enter **Audience**.

7. Repeat step 3, step 4, and step 5 to configure the **toggle2**. Note that you need to enter **2** in **CustomEventData** and **Host** in **Label** > **String**.

   During the interactive live video streaming, only the host can be seen. If you want to switch the client role after joining the channel, call the `setClientRole` method.

### 4. Set the local video view

To make the host see the local video before starting the interactive live streaming, you need to set the local video view before joining a channel. Use the following steps:

1. In `HelloWorld.js`, call `enableVideo` to enable the video module and `startPreview` to start the local video preview.

   ```typescript
   cc.Class({

       ...

       onLoad: function () {

           ...

           // Enable the video module.
           agora.enableVideo();
           // Start the local video preview.
           agora.startPreview();
       },

       ...
   });
   ```

2. In Cocos Creator, navigate to **Node Library** > **Cloud Nodes**, and add **AgoraVideoRender** to the **Scene**.
 Once added successfully, in the **assets** folder of the **Assets** panel, you can see **cloud-component** folder which contains `AgoraVideoRender.js` and `AgoraVideoRender.prefab` files.

### <a name="join"></a>5. Join a channel

After setting a client role and the local video view, do the following to join a channel:

1. In Cocos Creator, add a button for joining or leaving a channel. navigate to **Node Library** > **Builtin Nodes**, and add a **Button** component to the **Scene**.

2. On the **Node Tree** panel, click **button** > **Background** > **Label**. On the **Properties** panel, find **Label** > **String**, and modify the string to **Join a channel**.

3. In `HelloWorld.js`, define a `clickButton` method to set the events when clicking the button.

   ```typescript
   cc.Class({

       ...

       // Set the events when clicking the button.
       // If the user joins a channel, the joined variable is true, and the SDK calls leaveChannel when the user clicks the button.
       // If the user leaves a channel, the joined variable is false, and the SDK calls joinChannel when the user clicks the button.
       clickButton: function () {
           if (this.joined) {
               this.leaveChannel();
           } else {
               this.joinChannel();
               }
       },

       ...
   });
   ```

4. Call `joinChannel`, and enter a token, a channel name, and a user ID.

   ```typescript
   cc.Class({

       ...

       joinChannel: function () {
           // Join a channel.
           // Replace YOUR_TOKEN with the token you generated.
           // Replace CHANNEL_NAME with the channel name that you use to generate the token.
           // Enter a user ID in uid.
           agora.joinChannel('YOUR_TOKEN', 'CHANNEL_NAME', '', uid);
       },

       ...
   });
   ```

5. In the `onJoinChannelSuccess` callback, add the logic to determine whether the local user joins the channel to dynamically change the label of the **button** component. Note that you need to remove the original definition of the label in `HelloWorld.js` as follows:

   - In `Properties`, remove `text: 'Hello, World!'`.
   - In `onLoad`, remove `this.label.string = this.text;`.

   ```typescript
   cc.Class({

       ...

       // Occur when a local user joins a channel.
       onJoinChannelSuccess: function (channel, uid, elapsed) {
           // After the user leaves the channel, the label of the button changes to Leave the channel.
           this.joined = true;
           this.label.string = 'Leave the channel';
       },

       ...
   });
   ```

6. Return to **Cocos Creator**, and click **Canvas** on the **Node Tree** panel. On the **Properties** panel, find the **HelloWorld** component script, and add the **Label** of the **button** component to the script to dynamically modify the label of the button.
   ![1606314807023](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1606314807023)
7. On the **Node Tree** panel, click **button**, find **Button** > **Check Events** on the **Properties** panel, and add a check event.

8. Add the **Canvas** to the **cc.Node** property box of the check event. In the two drop-down boxes following the **cc.Node** property box, select the scene (**HelloWorld**) and the check event (**clickButton**) in turn.

### 6. Set the remote video view

During the interactive video streaming, you should be able to see all the hosts, regardless of your role.

Shortly after a remote host joins the channel, the SDK gets the host's user ID in the `onUserJoined` callback. You can set the remote video view as follows:

1. In `HelloWorld.js`, import the `AgoraVideoRender` cloud component to render the remote video view. In the `onUserJoined` and `onUserOffline` callbacks, add logic to determine whether Cocos Creator renders the remote video.

   ```typescript
   // Import the AgoraVideoRender cloud component.
   const AgoraVideoRender = require('AgoraVideoRender');

   cc.Class({

       ...

       properties: {

           ...

           // Add a remote video view.
           target: {
               default: null,
               type: cc.Prefab
           }
       },

       ...

       // Occur when a remote host joins the channel. This callback gets the user ID of the remote host.
       onUserJoined: function (uid, elapsed) {
           if (this.remoteUid === undefined) {
               this.remoteUid = uid;
               // Add a Prefab.
               const render = cc.instantiate(this.target);
               // Set the uid of the AgoraVideoRender component to the uid of the remote host.
               render.getComponent(AgoraVideoRender).uid = this.remoteUid;
               // Add AgoraVideoRender component to the Scene
               cc.director.getScene().addChild(render, 0, `uid:${this.remoteUid}`);
               // Set the size of the remote video view.
               render.setContentSize(160, 120);
               // Set the position of the remote video view.
               render.setPosition(300, 120);
           }
       },

       // Occur when a remote host leaves the channel.
       onUserOffline: function (uid, reason) {
           if (this.remoteUid === uid) {
               // When a remote host leaves the channel, set the uid to undefined.
               cc.director.getScene().getChildByName(`uid:${this.remoteUid}`).destroy();
               this.remoteUid = undefined;
           }
       },

       ...
   });
   ```

2. In Cocos Creator, click **Canvas** on the **Node Tree** panel. On the **Assets** panel, find **assets** > **cloud-component** > **AgoraVideoRender** > **AgoraVideoRender.prefab**, and add it to **HelloWorld** > **Target** of **Canvas**.
   ![1606314817942](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1606314817942)

### 7. Leaves the channel

Call the `leaveChannel` method to leave the current channel according to your scenario, for example, when the interactive streaming ends, when you need to close the app, or when your app runs in the background.

After leaving the channel, if you want to exit the app or release the memory of the Agora engine, call `release` to destroy the Agora engine.

```typescript
cc.Class({

    ...

    leaveChannel: function () {
        // Leaves the channel.
        agora.leaveChannel();
        if (this.remoteUid !== undefined) {
            // Remove the remote video view.
            cc.director.getScene().getChildByName(`uid:${this.remoteUid}`).destroy();
            this.remoteUid = undefined;
        }
        // After the local user leaves the channel, the label of the button changes to Join a channel.
        this.joined = false;
        this.label.string = 'Join a channel';
        // Destroy the Agora engine.
        agora.release();
    },

    // Occur when the local user leaves the channel.
    onLeaveChannel: function (stats) {}

    ...
});
```

## Run the project

Agora recommends running and debugging your project through a physical Android or iOS device. See [Publish to native](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/2.2/manual/en/publish/publish-native.html).

For example, to build and run an iOS project, you can do the following:

1. In Cocos Creator, click **Project** > **Build**.
2. Enter the title (such as **hello_world**), the platform, and the build path, and click **Build**.
3. Once the build is completed, click the **Open** button at the right of the **Build Path** to open the `build` folder.
4. Under the `./jsb-link/frameworks/runtime-src/proj.ios_mac` path, find and open your iOS project (such as `hello_world.xcworkspace`).
5. In Xcode, select your iOS device, and click the button to build and run your project. After the project runs successfully run the project, you can see your video.
6. If you want to experience an interactive live video streaming, you can also use the [Agora Web sample app](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) to interact with your iOS device. Ensure that you enter the same App ID, channel name, and temporary token in the Agora Web sample app as in your iOS project.

When the interactive live video streaming starts successfully, hosts can see their own videos, and audience members can see the video of hosts in the app.

## Q&A

Q: I set a correct build path. Why do I receive the `xxx.o:No such file or directory` error message?
A: The cause of this problem is that the bulild path is too long. You need to shorten the bulild path. For example, change the bulild path to the disk root.
