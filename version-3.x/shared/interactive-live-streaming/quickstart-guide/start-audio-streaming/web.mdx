This article describes how to build a Web project that implements the live audio streaming function using the Agora SDK.

## Prerequisites

- A valid Agora [account](../reference/manage-agora-account#sign-up-and-log-in).
- An [Agora project](../reference/manage-agora-account) with an App ID and a temp token
- A Windows or macOS computer meets the following requirements:
  - Access to the Internet. If your network has a firewall, follow the instructions in [Firewall Requirements](../reference/firewall) to access Agora services.
  - A browser that matches the [supported browser list](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/general-product-inquiry/browser_support). Agora highly recommends using the [latest version](https://www.google.com/chrome/) of Google Chrome.
  - A physical audio sampling device, such as a built-in microphone.
  - An Intel 2.2GHz Core i3/i5/i7 processor (2nd generation) or equivalent

## Create a Web project

1. Create a folder for this project, and then create files in the following structure:

   ```bash
   .
   ├── index.html
   ├── scripts
   │   └── script.js
   └── styles
      └── style.css
   ```

   The `index.html` file is the web page; the `script.js` file includes the JavaScript code that implements the live streaming function; the `style.css` file defines the front-end styles.

2. Add the following code to `index.html`.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <title>Live Streaming</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/style.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>
           Live Streaming<br><small style="font-size: 14pt;">Powered by Agora.io</small>
       </h1>
       <h4>Local video</h4>
       <div id="me"></div>
       <h4>Remote video</h4>
       <div id="remote-container">
       </div>
       <script src="./scripts/script.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. Add the following code to `style.css`.

   ```css
   *{
       font-family: sans-serif;
   }
   h1,h4{
       text-align: center;
   }
   #me{
       position: relative;
       width: 50%;
       margin: 0 auto;
       display: block;
   }
   #me video{
       position: relative !important;
   }
   #remote-container{
       display: flex;
   }
   #remote-container video{
       height: auto;
       position: relative !important;
   }
   ```

## Integrate the SDK

Choose one of the following methods to obtain the Agora Web SDK:

### Method 1: Through npm

This method requires npm; see [Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for details.

1. Run the following command to install the SDK:

   ```bash
   npm install agora-rtc-sdk
   ```

2. Add the following code to the JavaScript code in your project:

   ```javascript
   import AgoraRTC from 'agora-rtc-sdk'
   ```

### Method 2: Through the CDN

Add the following code to the line after `<head>` in the `index.html` file:

```
<script src="https://cdn.agora.io/sdk/release/AgoraRTCSDK-3.6.11.js"></script>
```

### Method 3: Through the Agora website

1. Download the latest [Agora Web SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/sdks).

2. Copy the `AgoraRTCSDK-3.6.11.js` file to the `scripts` directory.

3. Add the following code to the line after `</body>` in the `index.html` file:

   ```javascript
   <script src="./AgoraRTCSDK-3.6.11.js"></script>
   ```

## Implementation

Once the project is set up, use the core APIs of the Agora Web SDK in `script.js` to implement the basic live audio streaming function.

You need to work with two types of objects when using the Agora Web SDK:

- The client object, which represents the local client. The Client methods provide the major functions for a voice/video call, such as joining a [channel](../reference/glossary#channel) and [publishing](../reference/glossary#publish) a stream.
- Stream objects, which represent the local and remote [streams](../reference/glossary#media-stream). The Stream methods define the behaviors of a stream object, such as the playback control and audio profiles. When you call a Stream method, you need to distinguish between the local and the remote streams.

The following figure shows the API call sequence of the basic interactive streaming. Note that these methods apply to different objects.

![img](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592907224846)

Before you begin, it is helpful to define some functions to handle errors and add/remove views of remote users. Add the following code to the beginning of the `script.js` file.

```javascript
// Handle errors.
let handleError = function(err){
        console.log("Error: ", err);
};

// Query the container to which the remote stream belong.
let remoteContainer = document.getElementById("remote-container");

// Add video streams to the container.
function addVideoStream(elementId){
        // Creates a new div for every stream
        let streamDiv = document.createElement("div");
        // Assigns the elementId to the div.
        streamDiv.id = elementId;
        // Takes care of the lateral inversion
        streamDiv.style.transform = "rotateY(180deg)";
        // Adds the div to the container.
        remoteContainer.appendChild(streamDiv);
};

// Remove the video stream from the container.
function removeVideoStream(elementId) {
        let remoteDiv = document.getElementById(elementId);
        if (remoteDiv) remoteDiv.parentNode.removeChild(remoteDiv);
};
```

### 1. Create a client

Create and initialize a client object to control the call. You need to replace `yourAppId` with the App ID of your Agora project. See [Get an App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) for details.

```javascript
let client = AgoraRTC.createClient({
    mode: "live",
    codec: "vp8",
});

client.init("yourAppId");
```

Pay attention to the settings of `mode` and `codec` in the AgoraRTC.createClient method:

- `mode` determines the [channel profile](../reference/glossary#channel-profile). Agora recommends using the `rtc` mode for one-to-one or group calls and the `live` mode for interactive live streaming.
- `codec` sets the codec that the web browser uses for encoding and decoding. If your app needs to support Safari 12.1 or earlier, set it as `h264`. Otherwise, set it as `vp8`.

### 2. Set the client role

A live streaming channel has two client roles: host and audience, and the default role is audience. After setting the channel profile to `"live"`, your app may use the following steps to set the client role:

1. Ask the user to choose a role.
2. Call the `Client.setClientRole` method and pass in the client role set by the user.

```javascript
// The value of role can be "host" or "audience".
client.setClientRole(role);
```

In a live streaming channel, only the host can be heard and seen. You can also call `setClientRole` to change the user role after joining a channel.

### 3. Join a channel

Call `client.join` to join a channel. You need to generate a token to replace `yourToken` in the code sample below.

- For testing, you can [generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token)  in Agora Console.
- For production, Agora recommends using a token generated at your server. See [Generate a Token](../basic-features/token-server).

```javascript
// Join a channel
client.join("yourToken", "myChannel", null, (uid)=>{
  // Create a local stream
}, handleError);
```

### 4. Create and publish a local stream

If the user role is set as host, after joining a channel, you can create a local stream and publish it to the channel.

<div class="alert note">If the user role is set as audience, skip this step.</div>

Add the following code after `// Create a local stream` in `client.join`:

```javascript
let localStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
    audio: true,
    video: false,
});
// Initialize the local stream
localStream.init(()=>{
    // Play the local stream
    localStream.play("me");
    // Publish the local stream
    client.publish(localStream, handleError);
}, handleError);
```

### 5. Subscribe to remote streams

When a remote user publishes a stream, the SDK triggers the `stream-added` event. Listen to this event, and subscribe to the remote stream in the callback.

```javascript
// Subscribe to the remote stream when it is published
client.on("stream-added", function(evt){
    client.subscribe(evt.stream, handleError);
});
// Play the remote stream when it is subsribed
client.on("stream-subscribed", function(evt){
    let stream = evt.stream;
    let streamId = String(stream.getId());
    addVideoStream(streamId);
    stream.play(streamId);
});
```

When a remote user unpublishes the stream or leaves the channel, stop the stream playback, and remove its view.

```javascript
// Remove the corresponding view when a remote user unpublishes.
client.on("stream-removed", function(evt){
    let stream = evt.stream;
    let streamId = String(stream.getId());
    stream.close();
    removeVideoStream(streamId);
});
// Remove the corresponding view when a remote user leaves the channel.
client.on("peer-leave", function(evt){
    let stream = evt.stream;
    let streamId = String(stream.getId());
    stream.close();
    removeVideoStream(streamId);
});
```

## Run the project

Agora recommends running and debugging your project through a local web server. In this section, we use the npm `live-server` package to set up a local web server.
<div class="alert note">
	<li>Running the web app through a local server (localhost) is for testing purposes only. In production, ensure that you use the HTTPS protocol when deploying your project.</li>
	<li>Due to security limits on HTTP addresses except 127.0.0.1, Agora Web SDK only supports HTTPS or <code>http://localhost</code> (<code>http://127.0.0.1</code>). Do not deploy your project over HTTP.</li>
</div>

1. Run the following command in the terminal to install live-server.

   ```bash
   npm i live-server -g
   ```

2. Change the directory to your project with the `cd` command.

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   live-server .
   ```

   This should automatically load the web app in your browser.

4. If the user role is set as host, you need to allow the browser to access your microphone in the pop-up window.

5. Duplicate the browser tab.

   You should hear echoes when you speak.

If the project does not work properly, open the browser console and check for errors. The following are the most likely errors:

- `INVALID_VENDOR_KEY`: Incorrect App ID or token. Ensure that you enter the correct App ID and token.
- `DYNAMIC_USE_STATIC_KEY`: Token missing. Because your Agora project enables App Certificate, you need a token to join the channel.
- `Media access:NotFoundError`: Camera/microphone error. Check that your microphone are working properly.
- `MEDIA_NOT_SUPPORT`: Please use HTTPS or localhost.

<div class="alert warning">Do not debug the web app on emulated mobile devices.</div>
