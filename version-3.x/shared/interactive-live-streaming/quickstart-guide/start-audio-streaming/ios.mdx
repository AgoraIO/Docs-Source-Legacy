The Agora SDK makes it easy to embed real-time voice and video interaction into iOS apps. It enables you to develop rapidly and easily to enhance your social, work, education and IoT apps.

This page shows the minimum code you need to add interactive live audio streaming into your app by using the Agora Voice SDK for iOS.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to integrate into your app in order to add Interactive Live Streaming Premium functionality.

![1625465916613](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625465916613)

As shown in the figure, the workflow for adding Interactive Live Streaming Premium in your project is as follows:

1. Set the client role
Each user in an Interactive Live Streaming Premium channel is either a host or an audience member. Hosts publish streams to the channel, and the audience subscribe to the streams.

2. Retrieve a token
A token is the credential that authenticates a user when your app client joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

3. Join a channel
Call `joinChannel` to create and join a channel. App clients that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

4. Publish and subscribe to audio and video in the channel
After joining a channel, app clients with the role of the host can publish audio and video. For an auidence memeber to send audio and video, you can call `setClientRole` to switch the client role.

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:
- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).
- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.
- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure. For this page, you use a temporary token with a validity period of 24 hours that you retrieve from Agora Console.
- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the live stream.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- Xcode 9.0 or later.
- An iOS device running iOS 9.0 or later.
- A valid [Agora account](https://console.agora.io/).
- A valid Agora project with an App ID and a temporary token. For details, see [Get Started with Agora](../reference/manage-agora-account).
- A computer with access to the internet. If your network has a firewall, follow the instructions in [Firewall Requirements](../reference/firewall).

## Project setup

In Xcode, follow the steps to create the environment necessary to add interactive live audio streaming into your app.

1. Create a new iOS app and configure the following settings:
   - **Product Name**: Any name you like.
   - **Team**: If you have added a team, choose it from the pop-up menu. If not, you can see the **Add account** button. Click it, input your Apple ID, and click **Next** to add your team.
   - **Organization Identifier**: The identifier of your organization. If you do not belong to an organization, use any identifier you like.
   - **Interface**: Choose **Storyboard**.
   - **Language**: Choose **Swift**.

2. Integrate the Voice SDK into your project:

   Go to **File** > **Swift Packages** > **Add Package Dependencies...**, and paste the following URL:

	 ```shellscript
	 https://github.com/AgoraIO/AgoraAudio_iOS
	 ```

   In **Choose Package Options**, specify the Voice SDK version you want to use. You need to fill in x.y.z for version x.y.z and x.y.z-r.a for version x.y.z.a. For example, fill in 3.5.0 for version 3.5.0 and 3.5.0-r.2 for version 3.5.0.2.

<div class="alert note"><li>For the Voice SDK, Agora provides Swift Packages for 3.5.0 or later versions.</li><li>If you have issues installing this Swift Package, try going to <b>File</b> > <b>Swift Packages</b> > <b>Reset Package Caches</b>.</li><li>For more integration methods, see <a href="#othermethods">Other approaches to integrating the SDK</a>.</li></div>

3. [Enable automatic signing](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev23aab79b4) for your project.
4. Set the deployment target for your app:
   1. In the [project editor](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devdab46c612), choose your target and click **General**.
   2. In the **Deployment Info** settings, choose the operating system version for your iOS app from the dropdown menu.


5. Add permissions for microphone usage.
   In the [Project navigator](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev7d7220fbb), open the `info.plist` file of your project and [add the property](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3f399a2a6) "Privacy - Microphone Usage Description".


## Implement a client for interactive live audio streaming

This section shows how to use the Agora Voice SDK to implement interactive live audio streaming in your app step by step.

### Implement the interactive live audio streaming logic

When your app opens, you create an `RtcEngine` instance, join a channel, and if the local user is a host, publish the local audio. When another host joins the channel, your app catches the join event and subscribes to the remote audio.

The following figure shows the API call sequence of implementing interactive live audio streaming:

![1637916400099](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637916400099)

To implement this logic, take the following steps:

1. Import the Agora kit and add the `agoraKit` variable.
   Modify your  `ViewController.swift` as follows:

    ```swift
    import UIKit
    // Add this line to import the Agora kit
    import AgoraRtcKit

    class ViewController: UIViewController {

        // Add this line to add the agoraKit variable
        var agoraKit: AgoraRtcEngineKit?

        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
        }

    }
    ```

2. Initialize the app and join the channel.

   Call the core methods to initialize the app and join a channel. In this example app, this functionality is encapsulated in the `initializeAndJoinChannel` function.

   In `ViewController.swift`, add the following lines after the `viewDidLoad` function, and fill in your App ID, temporary token, and channel name:

    ```swift
    func initializeAndJoinChannel() {
        // Pass in your App ID here
        agoraKit = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(withAppId: "Your App ID", delegate: self)

        // For a live streaming scenario, set the channel profile as liveBroadcasting.
        agoraKit?.setChannelProfile(.liveBroadcasting)
        // And set the client role as broadcaster or audience.
        agoraKit?.setClientRole(.broadcaster)

        // Join the channel with a token. Pass in your token and channel name here
        agoraKit?.joinChannel(byToken: "Your token", channelId: "Channel name", info: nil, uid: 0, joinSuccess: { (channel, uid, elapsed) in
        })
    }
    ```

3. Add the callback that is triggered when a remote user joins the channel.
   In `ViewController.swift`, add the following lines after the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {
        func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, didJoinedOfUid uid: UInt, elapsed: Int) {
        }
    }
    ```

### Start and stop your app

Now you have created the interactive live audio streaming functionality, add the functionality of starting and stopping the app. In this implementation, a live stream starts when the user opens your app and ends when the user closes your app.

To implement the functionality of starting and stopping the app:

1. When the view is loaded, call `initializeAndJoinChannel` to join a live streaming channel.

   In `ViewController.swift`, add the `initializeAndJoinChannel` function inside the `viewDidLoad` function:

    ```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Add this line
        initializeAndJoinChannel()
    }
    ```

2. When the user closes this app, clean up all the resources used by your app.

   In `ViewController.swift`, add `viewDidDisappear` after the `initializeAndJoinChannel` function.

    ```swift
    override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
        agoraKit?.leaveChannel(nil)
        AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()
    }
    ```

## Test your app

To test your app on a physical device, do the following:

1. Check whether you fill in your App ID, temporary token, and channel name in `ViewController.swift`.
2. Connect an iOS device to your computer.
3. In Xcode, choose the device from the scheme menu in the [toolbar](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devf0d1df47a), and click the Run button.
4. On your device, launch the app and grant microphone access.
5. Ask a friend to join the live stream with you on the [demo app](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicLive/index.html). Your friend needs to enter the same App ID and channel name.
   If your friend joins as a host, you should be able to hear each other; if as an audience member, your friend can hear you but you cannot hear your friend.

## Next steps

Generating a token by hand is not helpful in a production context. [Authenticate Your Users with Tokens](../basic-features/token-server) shows you how to start live streaming with a token that you retrieve from your server.

### Other approaches to integrate the latest SDK

In addition to integrating the Agora Voice SDK for iOS through Swift Package, you can also import the SDK into your project through CocoaPods or by manually copying the SDK files.


**Automatically integrate the SDK with CocoaPods**

1. Install CocoaPods if you have not. See [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).
2. In Terminal, navigate to the root of your project folder, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.
3. Open the `Podfile`, and replace all contents with the following code. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project.

  ```
  # platform :ios, '9.0'
  target 'Your App' do
      pod 'AgoraAudio_iOS'
  end
  ```

4. In Terminal, run the `pod install` command to install the SDK. When the SDK is installed successfully, you can see  `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal and an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.
5. Open the `xcworkspace` file for any further steps.

**Manually copy the SDK files**

1. Go to [SDK Downloads](https://docs.agora.io/en/sdks?platform=ios), download the latest version of the Agora Voice SDK, and extract the files from the downloaded SDK package.


2. From the `libs` folder of the downloaded SDK package, copy the files or subfolders you need to the root of your project folder.


3. In Xcode, [link your target to the frameworks or libraries](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev51a648b07) you have copied. Be sure to choose **Embed & Sign** from the pop-up menu in the Embed column.

   <div class="alert note"><ul><li>Apple does not allow an app extension to contain any dynamic library. If you are integrating the Agora SDK to an app extension, choose <b>Do Not Embed</b> in the Embed column.</li><li>The Agora SDK uses libc++ (LLVM) by default. Contact support@agora.io if you want to use libstdc++ (GNU).

### Objective-C code sample

To implement interactive live audio streaming in your app using Objective-C:

1.Replace the contents in the  `ViewController.h` file with the following:

```objc
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import <AgoraRtcKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h>

    @interface ViewController : UIViewController <AgoraRtcEngineDelegate>
@property (strong, nonatomic) AgoraRtcEngineKit *agoraKit;

@end
```

2.Replace the contents in the `ViewController.m` file with the following:

```objc
#import "ViewController.h"
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface ViewController ()

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [self initializeAndJoinChannel];
}

- (void)initializeAndJoinChannel {
    // Pass in your App ID here
    self.agoraKit = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:@"Your App ID" delegate:self];
    [self.agoraKit setChannelProfile:AgoraChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting];
    [self.agoraKit setClientRole:AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster];
    [self.agoraKit joinChannelByToken:@"Your token" channelId:@"Channel name" info:nil uid:0 joinSuccess:^(NSString * _Nonnull channel, NSUInteger uid, NSInteger elapsed) {
    }];
}

- (void)rtcEngine:(AgoraRtcEngineKit *)engine didJoinedOfUid:(NSUInteger)uid elapsed:(NSInteger)elapsed {

}

- (void)viewDidDisappear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidDisappear:animated];
    [self.agoraKit leaveChannel:nil];
    [AgoraRtcEngineKit destroy];
}

@end

```

### Listening for audience events

The Agora Voice SDK does not report events of an audience member in a live streaming channel. Refer to [How can I listen for an audience joining or leaving an interactive live streaming channel](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/audience_event) if your scenario requires so.

<a name="earlierversion"></a>
### Integrate earlier versions of the SDK

Choose one of the following methods to integrate a version of the Agora iOS SDK earlier than v3.2.0.

**Method 1: Through CocoaPods**

1. Ensure that you have installed CocoaPods before performing the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.


3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project and replace `version` with the version of the SDK that you want to integrate. For information about the SDK version, see [Release Notes](../introduction/release-notes).

 ```
# platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'Your App' do
    pod 'AgoraAudio_iOS'
end
```

4. Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

**Method 2: Through your local storage**

You need to use different integration methods to integrate different versions of the SDK. Click the following version categories to expand the corresponding integration steps.

<details>
	<summary><font color="#3ab7f8">From v3.2.0 to v3.2.1</font></summary>

1. According to your requirements, choose one of the following methods to copy the `AgoraRtcKit.framework`, `Agorafdkaac.framework`, and `AgoraSoundTouch.framework` dynamic libraries to the `./project_name` folder in your project (`project_name` is an example of your project name):

   a. If you do not need to use a simulator to run the project, copy the above dynamic libraries under the path of `./libs` in the SDK package.
   b. If you need to use a simulator to run the project, copy the above dynamic libraries under the path of `./libs/ALL_ARCHITECTURE` in the SDK package. The dynamic libraries under this path contains the x86-64 architecture, which affects the distribution of your app in the App Store. See solutions in [Distribution consideration](#distribution).

2. Open Xcode, and navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

3. Click **+** > **Add Other…** > **Add Files** to add the `AgoraRtcKit.framework`, `Agorafdkaac.framework`, and `AgoraSoundTouch.framework` dynamic libraries. Ensure that the **Embed** attribute of these dynamic libraries is **Embed & Sign**.

   Once these dynamic libraries are added, the project automatically links to other system libraries.

### Distribution consideration

If you integrate dynamic libraries under the path of `./libs/ALL_ARCHITECTURE` in the SDK package, you need to remove the x86-64 architecture in the libraries before uploading the app to the App Store.

In Terminal, run the following command to remove the x86-64 architecture. Remember to replace `ALL_ARCHITECTURE/AgoraRtcKit.framework/AgoraRtcKit` with the path of the dynamic library in your project.

```shell
lipo -remove x86-64 ALL_ARCHITECTURE/AgoraRtcKit.framework/AgoraRtcKit -output ALL_ARCHITECTURE/AgoraRtcKit.framework/AgoraRtcKit
```

See more considerations in [Preparing Your App for Distribution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing_your_app_for_distribution).
