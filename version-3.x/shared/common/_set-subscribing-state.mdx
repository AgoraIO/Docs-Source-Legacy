## Overview

In real-time engagement, you may need to set the [subscribing](../reference/glossary#subscribe) state of audio and video streams according to your business scenarios. For example, after joining a channel, a user needs to unsubscribe from a remote user.

This article describes how to set the subscribing state in common scenarios.

<div class="alert note"><li>This article applies to the SDK v3.3.0 and later.</li><li>If you have upgraded the SDK from an earlier version to v3.3.0 or later, Agora recommends that you adjust your subscribing settings by referring to <a href="#api_changes">API changes</a > in order to avoid any impact on your business functions.</li><li>Subscribing to audio and video streams results in all associated usage costs.</li></div>

## API introduction

By default, users subscribe to all remote users' audio and video streams when joining a channel or switching to a channel. You can call the following APIs to set the subscribing state:

| API                                                          | Target                  | Requirements for calling the API                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoSubscribeAudio` or `autoSubscribeVideo` of `channelMediaOptions` | All remote users        | Set this API when calling `joinChannel`[2/2] or `switchChannel`[2/2] |
| `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams` or `muteAllRemoteVideoStreams`   | All remote users        | Call at any time in the channel                              |
| `muteRemoteAudioStream` or `muteRemoteVideoStream`           | A specified remote user | Call at any time in the channel                              |

<div class="alert note"><li>In the channel, the methods with prefixes <code>muteAll</code> or <code>muteRemote</code> can override the subscribing settings when joining a channel or switching to a channel.</li><li>The methods with prefixes <code>muteAll</code> and <code>muteRemote</code> are independent of each other. When the two methods are called together, the method that is called later takes effect.</li></div>

## Recommended settings

### Scenario one: Unsubscribe from specified users in a channel

If the user subscribes to all remote users when joining a channel or switching to a channel, the user may need to unsubscribe from one or more remote users in the channel. Agora recommends the following steps:

1. Use the default settings of the SDK when joining a channel or switching to a channel.
2. In the channel, call `muteRemoteAudioStream` (`uid`, `true`) or `muteRemoteVideoStream` (`uid`, `true`) to unsubscribe from specified remote users.

### <a name="scenario2"></a>Scenario two: Subscribe to specified users when joining a channel

The user may need to subscribe to one or more remote users when joining a channel or switching to a channel. Agora recommends the following steps:

1. Call `joinChannel`[2/2] or `switchChannel`[2/2] and set `autoSubscribeAudio(false)` or `autoSubscribeVideo(false)` to unsubscribe from all remote users.
2. In the channel, call `muteRemoteAudioStream` (`uid`,` false`) or `muteRemoteVideoStream` (`uid`,` false)` to subscribe to specified remote users.

### Scenario three: Subscribe to different remote users in a channel

The user may need to subscribe to one or more remote users when joining a channel or switching to a channel, and then subsequently change the subscribed remote users. Agora recommends the following steps:

1. Refer to [Scenario Two](#scenario2) to subscribe to specified remote users when joining a channel or switching to a channel.
2. When the user needs to change the subscribed remote users, you can first call `muteRemoteAudioStream(uid, true)` or `muteRemoteVideoStream(uid, true)` to unsubscribe the remote users you no longer need, and then call `muteRemoteAudioStream(uid, false)` or `muteRemoteVideoStream(uid, false)` to subscribe to the remote users you need.

<div class="alert note">
<li>If all the subscribed remote users are different before and after the change, to simplify the code logic, you can call <code>muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(true)</code> and <code>muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(true)</code> to unsubscribe all remote users first, and then call <code>muteRemoteAudioStream (uid, false)</code> or <code>muteRemoteVideoStream(uid, false)</code> to subscribe to the remote users you need.</li>
<li>Using the <code>mute</code> method to unsubscribe a remote user and then immediately subscribe to that user can cause a momentary lag in that user's audio and video, so Agora recommends that you use <code>muteRemote</code> instead of <code>muteAllRemote</code> to unsubscribe if you have subscribed to a remote user both before and after changing.</li>
</div>

### Scenario four: Set the subscribing state when interrupted by a system or third-party application event

In real-time engagement, the user may be interrupted by a system or third-party application event, such as receiving a system phone call. You typically need to set the subscribing state in two circumstances:

1. When the user starts using a system or third-party application and this application occupies the audio or video modules of the device, Agora recommends unsubscribing from all users.
2. When the user stops using a system or third-party application, Agora recommends resuming the original subscribing state.

The logic of subscribing settings varies according to the original subscribing state.

- If the user subscribes to **all** remote users in real-time engagement, Agora recommends setting the subscribing state as follows:

  - When the user starts using a system or third-party application, call `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(true)` or `muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(true)` to unsubscribe from all remote users.
  - When the user stops using a system or third-party application, call `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(false)` or `muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(false)` to resume subscribing to all remote users.

- If the user subscribes to **some** remote users in real-time engagement, Agora recommends setting the subscribing state as follows:

  - Record the original subscribing state. For example, the user only subscribes to remote users A and B.
  - When the user starts using a system or third-party application, call `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(true)` or `muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(true)` to unsubscribe from all remote users.
  - When the user stops using system or third-party applications, resume the original subscribing state according to the records in step one. For example, call the following methods to resume subscribing to remote users A and B:

     - Call `muteRemoteAudioStream(A, false)` and `muteRemoteVideoStream(A, false)` to resume subscribing to remote user A.
     - Call `muteRemoteAudioStream(B, false)` and `muteRemoteVideoStream(B, false)` to resume subscribing to remote user B.

## <a name="api_changes"></a>API changes

As of v3.3.0, Agora adds `joinChannel[2/2]` and `switchChannel[2/2]`, and modifies the logic for using `mute`-related methods. If you need to upgrade to v3.3.0 or later, Agora recommends that you adjust your subscribing settings as follows to avoid any impact on your business functions:

Earlier than v3.3.0:

- You cannot set the subscribing state when you join a channel or switch channels. By default, you subscribe to the audio or video streams in the current channel.

- `mute`-related methods can be called **both before and after** joining a channel or switching to a channel.

- The methods with the prefix `muteAll` (hereinafter referred to as `muteAll`) serve as a master switch, and the methods with the prefix `muteRemote` or `setDefaultMute` (hereinafter referred to as`muteRemote` and `setDefaultMute`) serve as sub-switches.

 ![1611154569739](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1611154569739)

  - Call `muteAll(true)` to disconnect the master switch, and the user unsubscribes from all audio and video streams. `muteRemote` or `setDefaultMute` does not take effect.

  - Call `muteAll(false)` to connect the master switch. `muteRemote` or `setDefaultMute` controls the user subscribing state.

    - Set `true` to disconnect the sub-switches, and the user unsubscribes from streams.
    - Set `false` to connect the sub-switches, and the user subscribes to streams.

- `muteAll(false)`does not resume subscribing to all audio or video streams, but only the original subscribing state.

As of v3.3.0:

- Deprecate `setDefaultMuteAllRemoteAudioStreams` and `setDefaultMuteAllRemoteVideoStreams`.
- When joining a channel or switching to a channel, call `joinChannel`[2/2] or `switchChannel`[2/2] to set the subscribing state.
- `mute`-related methods must be called **after** joining a channel or switching to a channel; otherwise these methods do not take effect.
- `muteAll` methods do not serve as a master switch. Each `mute`-related method can independently control the user's subscribing state.
  -  When `muteAll` and `muteRemote` methods are called together, the method that is called later takes effect.
  -  `muteAll` contains the function of `setDefaultMute`. Agora does not recommend calling `muteAll` and `setDefaultMute` together; otherwise the settings may not take effect.
- `muteAll(false)` resumes subscribing to all audio or video streams.
