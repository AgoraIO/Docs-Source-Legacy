### Costing examples

**Example 1 - Fixed package**: Suppose you are using Signaling 1.x. Your number of Peak Concurrent Users is less than 5K, Monthly Message Volume is less than 10M, and Storage usage is less than 5GB. The monthly billing will be $399 considering the Pro Package.

**Example 2 - Pay-as-you-go**: Suppose you are using Signaling 1.x. Your number of Peak Concurrent Users is 20K, Monthly Message Volume is 800M, and the Storage use is 10GB. The monthly billing will be as follows:

* PCU: 20K
  * PCU cost = 20000/1000 x $15 = $300 ($15 for every thousand of Peak Concurrent Users)
* Message count: 800M
  * Message cost = 800 x $1.5 = $1,200 ($1.5 for every million messages)
* Storage: 10GB
  * Storage cost = 10 x $7.5 = $75 ($7.5 for every GB of storage)
* **Total cost**: $300 + $1,200 + $75 = $1,575 (PCU + Messages + Storage)
