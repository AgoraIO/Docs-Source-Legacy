### Costing examples

**Example 1 - Fixed package**: Suppose you are using Signaling and the number of Peak Concurrent Users (PCU) is less than 5,000, the total message count per month is less than 10 million and storage usage is less than 5 GB. The monthly billing will be $399 considering the Pro Package.

**Example 2 - Pay-as-you-go**: Suppose you are using Signaling and the number of PCU is 20,000, the total message count per month is 7,051,000, and the storage is 10GB. The monthly billing will be as follows:

* PCU: 20,000
  * PCU Cost = 20,000/1000 x $15 = $300 ($15 for 1000 PCU)
* Message count: 7,051,000
  * Messages Cost = 7,051,000/1,000,000 x $1.50 = $10.576 ($1.50 for 1,000,000 messages)
* Storage: 10GB
  * Storage cost = 10 x $7.50 = $75 ($7.50 for 1GB of Storage)
* **Total cost**: $300 + $10.576 + $75 = $10.951 USD (PCU + Messages + Storage)
