### Billing examples

Refer to the following examples to understand how <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates your bill:

<details>
<summary>Example 1: DAU-Based Billing Example</summary>

For Enterprise Package customers using Signaling 1.x, the billing model is as follows:

- **Metering**: The system records DAU (Daily Active Users) throughout the month
- **Peak Determination**: The highest DAU value for the month is identified
- **Free Tier Deduction**: First 1,000 DAU are included at no charge
- **Billable Units**: Remaining DAU is divided into 1,000-user units (rounded up)
- **Rate Application**: $14.50 is charged per 1,000-user unit

**Sample Calculation**:

- Peak DAU for the month: 326,102 users
- Free tier allocation: 1,000 DAU
- Billable DAU: 326,102 - 1,000 = 325,102 DAU
- Billable units: 325,102 ÷ 1,000 = 325.102 units
- Monthly charge: 325.102 units × $14.50 per unit = $4,713.98
 
This DAU-based model remains unchanged for Enterprise Package customers using Signaling 1.x.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 2: Billing calculation for the Pro package</summary>

The Pro package has a fixed monthly fee of $399, which includes:

- Up to 2,500 peak concurrent users (PCU)
- Up to 150 million monthly messages
- Up to 10GB average storage utilization

If your usage stays within these thresholds, your monthly bill is the base subscription fee of $399 with no additional charges.

If you exceed these limits, additional usage is charged at the following overage rates:

| Resource              | Billing Unit               | Rate   |
|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|--------:|
| Peak Concurrent Users | 1,000 PCU                | $30.00 |
| Message Volume       | 1 Million messages       | $3.00  |
| Storage              | 1 GB (monthly average)   | $15.00 |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 3: Billing calculation for the Enterprise Package (Pay-as-you-go)</summary>

The Enterprise Package follows a pure consumption-based model where you pay only
for what you use.

Example Scenario: Consider a customer with the following monthly usage:

- 20,000 peak concurrent users
- 800 million messages sent
- 3.93 GB average storage utilization

Detailed Billing Calculation:

1. Peak Concurrent Users (PCU)
    - PCU Usage: 20,000 users (highest recorded in the month)
    - PCU Rate: $30.00 per 1,000 PCU
    - PCU Cost = (20,000 ÷ 1,000) × $30.00 = $600.00

2. Message Volume
    - Total Messages: 800 million
    - Message Rate: $3.00 per million messages
    - Message Cost = 800 × $3.00 = $2,400.00

3. Storage Utilization
    - Average Monthly Storage: 3.93 GB
    - Storage Rate: $15.00 per GB per month
    - Storage Cost = 3.93 GB × $15.00 = $58.95

4. Total Monthly Invoice
    - Total Monthly Cost = PCU Cost + Message Cost + Storage Cost
        - = $600.00 + $2,400.00 + $58.95
        - = $3,058.95
</details>

<summary>Example 4: Storage cost calculation</summary>

Storage is billed based on the average monthly utilization, calculated from hourly measurements.

Storage Calculation Process:
- **Hourly measurement**: Agora captures storage utilization every hour.
- **Monthly normalization**: For billing consistency, all months are normalized to 30 days (720 hours).

**Example**: For usage in March (a 31-day month):
- Week 1: 2 GB baseline storage
- Weeks 2-3: 6 GB during high usage period
- Week 4+: 2 GB returning to baseline

**Calculation**:
- Week 1 (7 days): 2 GB × (7 days × 24 hours) = 336 GB-hours
- Weeks 2-3 (14 days): 6 GB × (14 days × 24 hours) = 2,016 GB-hours
- Week 4+ (10 days): 2 GB × (10 days × 24 hours) = 480 GB-hours

Total GB-hours: 336 + 2,016 + 480 = 2,832 GB-hours

Normalized Monthly Average: 2,832 GB-hours ÷ 720 hours (Normalization) = 3.93 GB.

Normalization is the process of standardizing billing calculations to 30-day months (720 hours) regardless of actual calendar days which is 31 in this example.

Storage Cost = 3.93 GB × $15.00 per GB = $58.95
